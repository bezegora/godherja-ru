 artifact_create.0008.desc:0 "I've called for a suitable blacksmith to be summoned before me for the task, but first I need to decide how far I am willing to go, and what exactly I want. Some new armor might help present me as the splitting image of rulership I am, while a new weapon would no doubt be of use in battle and possibly outside of it. Then again, I could always use some new fineries..."

 artifact_create.0001.desc_crown:0 "Armor! Beautiful armor! Or at least functional, now the only question is how much exactly I spend. I could do something truly grand, but obviously I ultimately have to worry about the finances, and there's no promise that if I spend the treasury that what I receive will be entirely worth the investment..."
 artifact_create.0001.desc_jewelry:0 "Some fineries, a staff, crown and jewelry, to show everyone my regalia. Nothing to skimp out on, but such things can be surprisingly expensive. Getting something grand will no doubt impress the court, but bankruptcy is probably not in fashion at the moment..."
 artifact_create.0001.a:0 "Just something functional is all I need."

What’s more, we may be able to improve the item, with your support. With your approval, we are prepared to begin further work immediately."

 artifact_create.0004.desc:0 "A representative from my smiths is hurried before me and, against my initial hopes, he brings poor news.\n\n"M'lord..." he starts. "I... well my assistant, no good lad, Meldrick, the little simpleton... well... well we were going to..." what comes next is a long tirade of complaints and excuses which simply informs me that the item my smiths had been commissioned to create has come out of far poorer quality than intially hoped, and I have the sneaking feeling that Meldrick is simply a fallman for a greater bout of incompetence. I could let them simply continue on, or I could fire the lot of them and spend the coin to get someone hopefully more competent."
 artifact_create.0004.a:0 "What can we salvage here?"

 artifact_create.0006.improve.desc:0 "While the initial designs were adequate, adequacy is not the place for one of my stature! I have put my smiths to work on some potential upgrades that I have been informed of, with the hopes that the final result can be further improved from initial designs at a minimum cost... and, well...\n\nThe result has left me giddy beyond measure! The item is apparently far beyond even my wildest expectations, and it should come out even better than I initially hoped!"
 artifact_create.0006.degrade.desc:0 "While the initial designs were adequate, but adequacy is not the place for one of my stature! I have put my smiths to work on some potential upgrades that I have been informed of, with the hopes that the final result can be further improved from initial designs at a minimum cost... and, well...\n\n The result has been disappointing, with the reports from my smiths indicating that the attempted improvements have actually degraded the quality of the work. It seems the winds of fate have not been kind to me."
 artifact_create.0006.fallback.desc:0 "While the initial designs were adequate, but adequacy is not the place for one of my stature! I have put my smiths to work on some potential upgrades that I have been informed of, with the hopes that the final result can be further improved from initial designs at a minimum cost... and, well...\n\nThe result has been adequate, with the initial reports indicating improvements in several key areas."
 artifact_create.0006.a:0 "An acceptable outcome. Let us complete the design…"
 artifact_create.0006.b:0 "Rats! Let us complete the design..."
 
 artifact_create.0007.t:0 "An even better creation?"
 artifact_create.0007.desc:0 "As I have eagerly awaited news from my smiths, I have begun to wonder, is great enough? Would it not be possible to put in some extra effort, and create an item truly worthy of the ages? Perhaps it won't be that great, but something truly inspiring. If I just... demanded some effort, put in more funding, put in more time, perhaps we could reach some dizzying new heights of craftsmanship. There's always the risk, however, that the finished product may be worse off. Any modifications made through the smithing process carries this risk, and asking for blacksmiths to give me the sun and stars may end up having the opposite effect. The decision, as always, is mine and mine alone."
 artifact_create.0007.a:0 "We can go further..."
 artifact_create.0007.a.tt:0 "I will try and produce a Rarity 4 artifact."
 artifact_create.0007.b:0 "I should stop here. What I had commissioned was perfectly acceptable."
 
 artifact_create.0008.t:0 "What to make, what to make..."
 artifact_create.0008.desc:0 "Now I need to decide what type of artifact I want exactly. Perhaps a sword to show the nobility of my rank... or perhaps a suit of armor, that may be more useful in certain other situations. I could even commission a set a beautiful crown jewels to impress everyone in my court."
 artifact_create.0008.a:0 "A deadly weapon!"
 artifact_create.0008.a.tt:0 "The finished artifact will be a weapon."

 artifact_create.0009.t:0 "The Work Completed"
 artifact_create.0009.desc:0 "As my smiths approach, flanked by guardsmen, they carry with them the sealed case carrying the item I commissioned what seems so long ago. My throat tightens, has all of the efforts been for naught? Will I carry with me the first of a true artifact that shall be passed, rightfully cherished, down my family line for generations to come? The thoughts race through my mind as with shaking hands I unclasp the seals and find..."
 artifact_create.0009.a:0 "A stunning success! A true artifact!"
 artifact_create.0009.a.tt:0 "A perfect adequate, just as I wished for!"
 artifact_create.0009.b:0 "A dismal failure! Damn it all!"
 artifact_create.0009.c:0 "Nothing. Useless junk."

 artifact_hunt.0001.t:0 "The Hunt Begins"
 artifact_hunt.0001.desc:0 "Through my recent exploits I have come across evidence of a possible item that has lain hidden to historians for some time. Of course, it could all be just a fanciful rumor, old wives' tales, or possibly even outright fabrications. Still, on the chance chat these whispers are true, I would be foolish to pass up the opportunity. Artifacts of historical note can be of massive value to those with an eye for it, and any ruler possessing one would no doubt be the talk of the land for much time to come. My mind fills with images of magnificent helms, gleaming and gilded swords, and breastplates beaten by only the most skilled hands of history. I feel as if I am holding them all even now..."
 artifact_hunt.0001.a:0 "Time to go hunting!"
 artifact_hunt.0001.b:0 "Maybe some other time."
 
 artifact_hunt.0002.t:0 "Hired Help"
 artifact_hunt.0002.desc:0 "Why should I bother chasing down leads on what very well turn out to be a wild goose chase? I have so much more important, patently real issues to handle at court. I simply can't spare any time to personally look into rumors. That doesn't mean I have to ignore them however, because to do so could prove quite foolish indeed. Instead of heading out myself I have decided to hire some locals to do the searching for me. Hunters, trappers, veterans of past wars, people who ought to know the lay of the land. They'll be good and trustworthy as long as I pay them a fair amount in exchange for finding the artifact."
 artifact_hunt.0002.a:0 "Good luck!"
 artifact_hunt.0002.b:0 "Perhaps I should save my gold for a more certain endeavor."
 
 artifact_hunt.0003.t:0 "The Ranging"
 artifact_hunt.0003.desc:0 "Any good leader must be willing to get his hands dirty in the pursuit of glory and power, or so the storytellers have told us. Today, I will lead a ranging of my personal retinue to search for the supposedly nearby artifact. The party will be broken up into pairs and sent to canvass as wide an area as is possible. Hopefully the excursion will prove to be a swift one, and without any interference from man, beast, or darker entity. The hunt has not been outfitted for heavy combat, and our main advantage will be out speed. With any luck I shall return home by tomorrow at the latest, my new artifact by my side."
 artifact_hunt.0003.a:0 "We ride!"
 artifact_hunt.0003.b:0 "I have other battles to win."
 
 artifact_hunt.0004.t:0 "Cutting A Deal"
 artifact_hunt.0004.desc:0 "Apparently the artifact I've been looking for has actually found its way into the hands of a minor neighboring noble. They might not be so willing to just part with it, even for a good sum of coin. Of course, seeing as how I am the dominant lord in this region, I could exert my power as well as my own personal charm in order to get them to budge. Should that prove not enough, I could go a step further and resort to threats and cajoling. I just hope they'll listen to reason before it comes to anything so brutish."
 artifact_hunt.0004.a:0 "Time to dash off an invitation."
 artifact_hunt.0004.b:0 "Perhaps I should save my gold for a more certain endeavor."
 
 artifact_hunt.0005.t:0 "Hitting The Scrolls"
 artifact_hunt.0005.desc:0 "Searching around aimlessly might be well and good for the common folk, but I am above such wastes of time! I've found bits and pieces of information regarding the artifact rumored to be nearby. By analyzing the clues left behind in these ancient tomes and scrolls, I can significantly narrow down the possible resting place of my target, making the most difficult part of this task all the simpler. Once I have decoded the location, I can simply dispatch some scholars with skills in archeology to secure my new prize."
 artifact_hunt.0005.a:0 "Now which scroll was it?"
 artifact_hunt.0005.b:0 "On second thought, this will likely be a pointless endeavor."
 
 artifact_hunt.0006.t:0 "A Bureaucratic Break"
 artifact_hunt.0006.desc:0 "My steward has brought me word of a most fortunate development in my search for the artifact! It seems that local records may hold the key to retrieving my target. Of course, many of these documents are quite dense and will require careful reading and cross-referencing if I am to secure an understanding of them. My steward has pledged to help me discern some of the possible ciphers and codes he believes were hidden away in these records. Still, given how hard someone has worked to keep this treasure hidden, I cannot be certain we will be able to find success."
 artifact_hunt.0006.a:0 "Get me an abacus."
 artifact_hunt.0006.b:0 "Maybe a shall wait for a rainy day to crack this mystery."
 
 artifact_hunt.0007.t:0 "Benevolent Compulsion"
 artifact_hunt.0007.desc:0 "As I finish my hunt, the success of it bringing me great joy, a certain strange feeling overtakes me. It is not an unpleasant feeling, rather being like a warm compulsion, pulling me towards something unknown. I turn from my path and walk towards the mysterious and unfamiliar force drawing me somewhere else. Inevitably, I reach the place it was trying to bring me, finding a certain object where the pull is strongest, at which point the feeling vanishes."
 artifact_hunt.0007.a:0 "Perhaps this was fate..."
 artifact_hunt.0007.b:0 "Maybe some things are best left alone..."
 
 artifact_hunt.0008.t:0 "No Luck"
 artifact_hunt.0008.desc:0 "Despite my best efforts, the search for what could have been a legendary artifact has turned up naught. Whether it was from my own failings or the others I enlisted, the trail has gone cold."
 artifact_hunt.0008.a:0 "What a shame."

 ### Artifacts

 artifact_1_name:0 "Reichskrone"
 artifact_1_desc:0 "Crafted in western Germany during the 10th century, the Reichskrone is the symbol of Imperial authority over central Europe. Crafted to resemble the Byzantine crowns of Eastern Rome, the gold enjeweled diadem is befitting of only those of the regality to claim the title of Emperor of the Emperor of the Romans.\n\nCan only be equipped by a Catholic emperor."
 artifact_1_modifier:0 "Reichskrone"
 artifact_1_passive:0 "Reichskrone"
 
 artifact_2_name:0 "Imperial Diadem"

 artifact_3_name:0 "Iron Crown of Lombardy"
 artifact_3_desc:0 "The Iron Crown of the Lombards is not iron at all, but in fact resplendent gold, silver, and gems. So called because of the band within it claimed to be beaten out of an iron nail from the true cross, the crown is a symbol of imperial rule of all sorts over the realms of Italia."
 artifact_3_modifier:0 "Iron Crown of Lombardy"
 
 artifact_4_name:0 "Longsword"
 artifact_4_desc:0 "Although the sword is one of the most common weapons in the world, this one is a bit uncommon. It is a bit shinier, a bit flashier, a bit more durable than those around it, on account of its better forging by a talented smith. But whether this makes the wielder a bit better at killing foes depends entirely on who's wielding it."
 artifact_4_modifier:0 "Longsword"
 
 artifact_5_name:0 "Fine Longsword"
 artifact_5_desc:0 "Anyone with a sharp eye who looks at this sword can tell it is of good make, and it bears the mark of a locally renowned blacksmith at the base of the blade. Although it lacks the ornamentation of some ceremonial weapons, its materials are high-quality and it is a boon to any skilled fighter who wields it."
 artifact_5_modifier:0 "Fine Longsword"
 
 artifact_6_name:0 "Sword of Heroes"
 artifact_6_desc:0 "This sword has a regal air about it, combining a well-sharpened and polished blade with a gilded hilt and a decorated scabbard. Whether wielded by a seasoned swordsman, a renowned knight, or a stately lord, this weapon seems suited for the hands of a truly skilled individual."
 artifact_6_modifier:0 "Sword of Heroes"
 
 artifact_7_name:0 "Sword of Legends"
 artifact_7_desc:0 "This sword seems to exude a sense of #EMP greatness!#! Just seeing it causes the imagination to conjure up images of valiant knights slaying dragons, noble kings charging into battle, and legendary duelists slicing opponents to ribbons. Even if it may not have been forged by a god or wielded by a saint, it certainly looks the part."
 artifact_7_modifier:0 "Sword of Legends"
 
 artifact_8_name:0 "Silver Crown"
 artifact_8_desc:0 "A simple but elegant silver crown, this simple but aesthetically pleasing headpiece is a symbol of an individual's wealth and prestige. Only those with status and renown would wear this in public."
 artifact_8_modifier:0 "Silver Crown"
 
 artifact_9_name:0 "Ruby Crown"
 artifact_9_desc:0 "Inlaid with silver and rubies, this ancient artifact was crafted by talented artisans from the lands of Rira. This crown is worth a small fortune, and one can be sure that whoever's head this diadem rests on is both extremely wealthy and powerful."
 artifact_9_modifier:0 "Ruby Crown"
 
 artifact_10_name:0 "Golden Crown"
 artifact_10_desc:0 "This fine crown is wrought from a dark red gold, with the finest ivory, as well as a multitude of expensive stones and gems. The quality is impeccable; only those of great status and power are worthy of wearing such a prestigious artifact."
 artifact_10_modifier:0 "Golden Crown"
 
 artifact_11_name:0 "Crown of Legends"
 artifact_11_desc:0 "Crafted from the hands of a master smith, platinum and gold are interweaved flawlessly into this visually stunning crown. Gems and diamonds glitter are inlined around the whole of this priceless artifact. A one of a kind artifact, this crown is worthy for only the most wealthy and powerful of rulers."
 artifact_11_modifier:0 "Crown of Legends"
 
 artifact_12_name:0 "Crown Jewels"
 artifact_12_desc:0 "These crown jewels are shining and certainly valuable, but were crafted without too much skill. Nevertheless, they effectively contribute to the awe inspired by their owner."
 artifact_12_modifier:0 "Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_13_name:0 "Fine Crown Jewels"
 artifact_13_desc:0 "This set of crown jewels was skillfully crafted and are somewhat remarkable to look upon. This shows the power held by their owner in an effective yet subdued manner."
 artifact_13_modifier:0 "Fine Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_14_name:0 "Remarkable Crown Jewels"
 artifact_14_desc:0 "This jewelry was created masterfully and essentially without flaw, they are truly incredible to behold. This shows the power they represent such that none can deny it."
 artifact_14_modifier:0 "Remarkable Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_15_name:0 "Regal Crown Jewels"
 artifact_15_desc:0 "These gems are breathtakingly beautiful and legendary beyond what words can express, they shine so bright their owner may as well possess the sky itself."
 artifact_15_modifier:0 "Regal Crown Jewels"
 
 artifact_16_name:0 "Sharpened Axe"
 artifact_16_desc:0 "Since the dawn of metallurgy, axes' basic designs have changed little throughout human history: a sharpened metal head affixed to a wooden handle. And this axe is no different. It may not look much fancier than the average forester's tool, but it can cut through bone as easily as it cuts wood."
 artifact_16_modifier:0 "Sharpened Axe"
 
 artifact_17_name:0 "Ornate Axe"
 artifact_17_desc:0 "Forged from good castle steel and with a sturdy wooden handle, this axe is a cut above the rest. It is perfectly capable of serving as a skilled fighter's weapon on the battlefield, and it certainly has the nicks and scars to prove it."

Primarily, the book details the ridiculousness of the idea that Aversaria is not already a Magi Fraternity. The author points out how only Aversarians are human, and only Magi truly human, and that all humans of the Aautokratia have the highest standard of life and amount of rights in the known world.

After a brief introduction of her relatively obscure origins, it starts the action in earnest with her 91 BI coup in Phanara, her subsequent conquest of most of Tower Isle in the ensuing first and second Parthenaxic wars, her invasion of Palitake in 79 BI in the third, her defeat at Kallane four years afterward and exile, her miraculous and brilliant return to power in 73 BI and finally, ultimate defeat and suicide at the Amis River in 68 BI.\n\nThough her attempt to unite the warring proto-Aversarian polei would come to naught, the two decades of unabated warfare and chaos would be the effective nail in the coffin to the already declining city-state system, and would lay the groundwork for Dhace'nox's own unification.

At various points joyful, heart-wrenching, grim, and in places outright bizarre and seemingly disjointed, the work is widely lauded as one of the crowning jewels of Aversarian literature.

 artifact_bookruleofmany_desc:0 "An analysis and praise of the curious political system of proto-Aversarian Naupyrna, written by a local aristocrat known as Kleistha'nax, likely in the late first century BI. Centuries of rule by the Aestraex dynasty were brought to an end in 421 BI when the city's last monarch, the vicious, insane and likely cannibalistic Dioxa'nex the Younger was toppled in a bloody coup that saw his entire line perish. After being unable to decide upon a successor, the citizenry instead decided to pick a ruler from their ranks by gathering up all magi and having each cast their vote upon who should take the throne. Thus was elected Eliaxa'cea, a great reformer and the first to bear the title of Archon.\n\nAfter a successful 17 year reign, rather than passing the throne to her eldest child as would be the norm, she decided to instead recall the magi of the city to yet again pick a successor - and thus a 400 year long tradition was born."

Second, that Naramaššin's invasion was completely unjustified, as disproven by the countless records of Orasbaeli, Valthronax, and Tylonic provocations in the years leading up to the conflict. Finally, the assertion that the Arakkariac realm was left shattered and in retreat after the Battle of Paelon Hill, instead painting it as an important, but ultimately relatively small clash that merely proved the unprofitability of continued conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the work posits that the conquest would likely have been successful regardless, had the empire not disintegrated in a bloody civil war after its monarch died in the same year as the battle."

The author, presumably the Legon, shines lights on his attempts to warn the government in Oraispol of the oncoming threat, only to receive silence at best, or outright mockery and accusations of treason at worst.\n\nThe final report is dated to 1221, the writer apparently having fallen mortally ill during the legion's march back to the Shattered Coast.

Furthermore, it confirms previously unverified reports of tribal humans dwelling within, but remarks that all attempts at communication were met with hostility, and that the single living captive - who was virtually constantly attempting to commit suicide until they succeeded - spoke no language known to scholars or barbarian interpreters. \n\nFinally, it touches upon the rumours of a newly emergent, third school of magic associated with the Fog and used by tribal magi, but makes no definitive judgement here, claiming that the current evidence is inconclusive at best."

 artifact_bookjacotwaldisse_desc:0 "The Life of Jacot den va Waldisse is a relatively short book discussing the Marcher Anti-Magi Jacot den va Waldisse's life from humble beginnings as the son of a miller in a destitute village to their refusal to accept their lord's attempts to restrict their Pathchoice and harried escape to the Crucible to join the Orders and the Path of Nullification to his fighting in and death during the Red River War. Told by a contemporary, Jacot's comrade and believed best friend Sir Michael Vavassky, the book is considered a classic of Marcher poetry and comradery. Vavassky's loss and sadness at Jacot's horrible death at the hands of the Arch-Lich Silas Stavro—Jacot having given his life to ensure the Lich was distracted away from several wounded men (Vavassky included)—evident in every sentence and stanza of poetry added to break up each chapter.\n\nModern scholars have suggested that Jacot and Vavassky had a far closer relationship than friendship, though this remains highly controversial."

It is customary for the comrades of fallen Anti-Magi and soldiers who give their lives at the location to etch their names into the wall, sometimes with a short few words about them, and many pieces of Marcher poetry or literature discuss the wall in detail or use it as a metaphorical device. This booklet however, nearly 200 pages in length, eschews this to simply detail every name and any other sentences connected to it. While of little value to the casual reader, simply remarking upon its pages is quite the sobering experience."

Unlike the poetry of most western cultures, Sjalvolki poetry tends to take the form of battlefield poetry (or, as the Sjalvolki have taken a liking to ships, sailing poetry), and tends to be rather anarchic in structure and prose. Still, many of the verses remain inciteful or bely an oft ignored thoughtfulness to many of the Sjalvolki warlords, with several poems by Cenware Witch-Breaker himself especially standing out, especially a surprisingly melancholy one on the field of the Elysian Pass."

The foreword claims that all information was provided by the Witch-Breaker himself, along with his contemporaries, and follows him from the legendary Dovahking in which he singlehandedly defeated all opposition (including his own brother) without killing a single man to claim his tribe to the Battle of the Elysian Pass where Chridade ended his journeys with the Sjalvolki.\n\nExtolling praise at nearly every possible moment, and containing several tales that are seemingly complete fantasy, Mitheux goes so far as to even add a chapter about how great a ruler he imagines Cenware would be and to fantasize about what it would be like to have him as a personal friend. Normally derided for such things, it nonetheless has received scholarly notice as the most notable contemporary attempt to document the legendary figure's life."

Maduex soon rises up the ranks, becomes the greatest of comrades with the Witch-Breaker himself, and then converts him to the Lifepath and becomes his Wayfather.\n\nThe most popular of Mitheux's works, the idea of imagining a history that isn't proved novel enough for the obvious... oddities in the narrative to be ignored, and it has since become popular for troubadors to reenact.

Known for his horrible brutality, mentorship of Aversarian warlord Gorassos, and loyalty to Aautokratir Aeschraes (commonly known as the ‘Lord of the Ashes’), this work seems to have been in progress sometime around when he was mortally wounded by Legan Isacea of Legio XXI ‘Axiaothea’ and his final execution by his pupil Gorassos.\n\nWhile A Lilac Grove is often crudely written and filled with multiple spelling and grammar mistakes, if one were to read it not knowing its author, they would most likely find it an exceptionally tender and heart felt series of tales with a masterful ability to control emotions through prose. Many readers would no doubt struggle not to cry as the young maiden who serves as the protagonist for many of the works struggles with her feelings of self doubt and discovery, especially as she falls in love with her best friend, the female Magi Anatheama. Readers would also be infuriated by the final poem, marked as the second to last, where Jadiaxa (the protagonist) resolves to beg Anatheama to run away with her as their village is consumed by the Fog… only for the works to end there, Delenel likely killed before he could finish the work."

 artifact_warcoin_name:0 "Legionary Coin"
 artifact_warcoin_desc:0 "Legionary coins were once currency used exclusively by the Aversarian Noble Legions starting some time in the late first century of Aversaria’s existence. With massive legionary camps growing their own economies and often resembling small cities while on campaign and at siege, commerce was extremely important for the soldiers to barter for goods with one another and the camp followers. While Aversaria would not have a single unified currency until the 5th century, the Legions were quick to create coins such as this to facilitate trade and to pay soldiers.\n\nWhile the Deodoxican Reforms and the establishment of a central currency meant that the practice would end, with most coins being taken by the crown and melted down into the new currency, many coins would survive on in an honorary capacity. For acts of valor or as a sign of appreciation by a higher ranking soldier, these coins would be passed down. While worth their weight in gold both for materials and to collectors, it was tradition to hold onto it until it was time to give it to a comrade who was deserving of similar reward or until retirement. While rarer over time, some State Legions were still passing the coins as of the 13th century, when they could be worth nearly as much as a soldier’s entire yearly pay."

Several passages go so far as to call the Aautokratir a ‘blithering idiot’ who was ‘in more danger of ending our rule in the valley as the Iyrossi’. An especially interesting passage details several small rebellions Dethediax was forced to negotiate or put down in secret to avoid an idiotic response from Oraispol, putting the common concept of the Iyrossi’s 1000 years of servitude into question. Even more interesting is a quick mention of the ‘children of Pothacleas’, whom Dethediax apparently had smuggled away into the mountains in order to quell a rather large scale uprising around them."

While the works are generally in support of women fighting and none dare try and blemish the name of the many Marcher heroes of the fairer sex, Andreaux ends the work by claiming that female knight’s are themselves an attack against the ‘strong and noble traditions’ that the title holds, despite a begrudging admittance that Lady Rose’s slaying of nearly a hundred undead and an Aversarian Magi before her 19th winter were somewhat impressive."
