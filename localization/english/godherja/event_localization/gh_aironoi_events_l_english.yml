 aversarian_opening.3.desc:0 "The Eastern Empire, Aironoi, has fallen into chaos. Aeschraes, the powermad fool used his ungodly magical power to break his rival Axiothea. Not only did he destroy his rival, but the Eastern Empire as well, and perhaps the world itself. Sensing weakness, a powerful Sjalvolki warlord known as Cormag Fenris conquered a large swath of the Eastern Empire. The [aversarian|E]s were unable to resist his conquest, and he conquered the eastern jewel of the Empire, Asiupoli. Should an Imperial King or Queen retake Asiupoli from the barbarian king, they will be able to rally their troops to reclaim the east!"
