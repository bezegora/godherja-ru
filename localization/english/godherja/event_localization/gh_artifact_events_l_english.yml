 artifact.0001.t:0 "The Curio Merchant"
 artifact.0001.desc:0 "My court has been abuzz with the news that a peddler of an unusual sort is passing through my lands. Allegedly, they have a variety of rarities, some almost priceless, in their stock. Perhaps I should go and see them for myself?"
 artifact.0001.a:0 "They sell fine weapons, according to the rumours."
 artifact.0001.b:0 "A dusty tome or two has been seen on offer."
 artifact.0001.c:0 "Apparently, they come with caged beasts."
 artifact.0001.d:0 "Some arcane knick-knacks are up for sale."

 artifact.0002.t:0 "The Weapon Stall"
 artifact.0002.desc:0 "'Yes, yes, swords, daggers, maces, and every blade you could think of under the Sun!'\n\nThe merchant is enthusiastic, if nothing else. The moment I show even a passing interest in one of their weapons, I am regaled with tales that would make one think that Eos himself would tuck tail and run upon seeing the futility of fighting its wielder.\n\nIf the stories are to be believed, of course."
 artifact.0002.a:0 "Hm, what about that one?"

 artifact.0003.t:0 "The Book Stall"
 artifact.0003.desc:0 "The weary old merchant is reading through the pages of some book, only occasionally peering over at me with seeming disinterest. Whenever I inquire as to the contents of his dusty old tomes, I am given a quick, unhelpful summary that could only be given by someone that has never read it, or completely doesn't care whether I will buy it or not.\n\nAt a glance, though, there is some interesting material here."
 artifact.0003.a:0 "Hm, what about that one?"
 artifact.0003.b:0 "I'm interested in this!"
 artifact.0003.c:0 "How much for one of these?"

 artifact.0004.t:0 "The Menagerie"
 artifact.0004.desc:0 "'We've got big beasts, little beasts, dangerous beasts, docile beasts, [sarradonian|E] beasts, water beasts, dead beasts, magic beasts -'\n\nThis merchant is likely going to be the bane of my wits. I cannot even take a look at one of the creatures in their pen without immediately being sidetracked with endless priase of their reliability."
 artifact.0004.a:0 "Hm, what about that one?"
 artifact.0004.b:0 "I'm interested in this!"
 artifact.0004.c:0 "How much for one of these?"
 artifact.0004.d:0 "None of this suits my needs."
 
 artifact.0005.t:0 "The Arcana Stall"
 artifact.0005.desc:0 "The odd, ancient magi is looking at me intently, a slight, unsettling grin on their face. Whatever item catches my eye, I am given their description and purpose - the merchant obviously knows what they are talking about.\n\nSome of these curios are powerful enough that one can even casually feel the magic they radiate."
 artifact.0005.a:0 "Hm, what about that one?"
 artifact.0005.b:0 "I'm interested in this!"
 artifact.0005.c:0 "How much for one of these?"
 artifact.0005.d:0 "Magic junk, for parlor tricks."

 artifact.0010.a:0 "I'm sold. Give me one of these."
 artifact.0010.b:0 "This is quite the fascinating creature!"
 artifact.0010.c:0 "I'd regret not purchasing such a marvelous beast."
 artifact.0010.d:0 "Everything! I want everything!"
 artifact.0010.e:0 "Amusing, but I don't need any foul-smelling beasts."
