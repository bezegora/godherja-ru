Compared to the chilly, Fogswept north, this Shattered Coast that [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] lead us to seems like paradise - and a paradise ripe for the picking for those with the fortitude.\n\n[aversaria|E] is dying, and brave men and women everywhere are but one great deed away from both glory and lands to call their own.

 sjalvolki_conquest.0003.desc:0 "Though [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] may have shown the ability to lead our people, I always knew that the most true path to glory one can take is the untread one - I've set out to carve a name and realm for myself deep in the enemy's lands, without relying on the support of the Imperrech's vast forces. And it's been a good time, of which songs will most surely be sung, but one that's slowly coming to an end.\n\nAlready, [attacker.GetFirstName]'s sentries have become a common occurence in the region, and today an emissary has arrived at my court. They bear gifts and platitudes, and quite favorable terms for my official support of the coalition. Any lands that I've taken by the graces of my own guile shall remain in my possession, and will not be subject to being carved up between a dozen petty chiefs.\n\nIf I were to refuse, though..."

I could grovel at the feet of the barbarian king for a chance of being able to retain even a small portion of my lands... but am I willing to debase myself like this?"

Before even stating the purpose of their visit, the envoy immediately prostrated themselves before me and praised my name - how genuine these words are is a matter of some question.\n\nOf course, this praise only came moments before the messenger began to make the case that their liege should be allowed to 'join' the Imperrech, in exchange for the concession of being allowed to retain at least some of [aversarian_mercy_requester.GetHerHis] lands."

It would probably be wise to accept, and quickly."

Not only have I debased myself by begging a barbarian for mercy, but my efforts have only seen [attacker.GetHerHim] spit in my face as well!"

The mood is far more subdued, but still happy, and I soon realize why I have been brought here. The [title_to_be_given.GetName] finds itself in need of a new ruler, and by virtue of my bravery on the battlefield, it was deemed just that I be offered the lands in question."

 sjalvolki_conquest.0120.desc:0 "As I join my men in roaming the countryside of Aversaria, we come across a great manor. At its sides are large fields of grain, wine vineyards, and olive trees. I recognize it as a plantation, where the Aversarians work their slaves to death. Likely spurred on by rumors of my approach, some of the slaves have taken up arms against the enforcers tasked with watching them in the fields. A slave spots me as I come closer to get a better look. Desperate, he calls out for help before an Aversarian curses, "Subhuman scum!", and swings his blade. The slave lets out a cry as he is cut down. Beside him, a few slaves pick up rocks and use their numbers to get the advantage on the distracted Aversarian and bash in his skull. Without my help, both sides will tear each other to shreds, leaving everything free for the taking. The loot from a manor like this normally always requires the sacrifice of lives, and better the lives of a few slaves than my men. However, looking into the eyes of the fallen slave who called out to me, I remember the Sjavolki teachings. We are the stewards of the world, we were sent by the gods to destroy evil."

They pledge their loyalty to me in thanks, and offer their assistance to my cause, determined to bring down the Aversarians. While [slave_leader.GetName] and his forces are capable, and could join the forces of my army, they've only ever fought in one proper battle. Alternatively, I could ask the newly freed slaves, accustomed to hard labor already, to join the baggage train and help ensuring the supply of all the Sjavolki, who would appreciate the contribution."

 sjalvolki_conquest.0122.desc:0 "As my campaign in the Aversarian countryside has continued, my men have come to me with reports of ruins across the land, and the wealth they've found within. Today, atop a hill, I came across an untouched ruin for myself, crumbling marble white pillars standing among rubble. Though the structure was half sunken into the Earth, the pillars were still far taller than me, almost pointing, urging me to look to the sky above. The symbols of the old age of antiquity. The pure white marble exudes power, still standing centuries after this place was likely abandoned. I've heard stories about these places, this was an old Aversarian academy! My head begins to spin as I picture the priceless relics beneath the surface here. But I remember a dark truth, that the Magi who taught under the stones that now lay crumbled under my feet were practitioners of evil. As I look back to the marble that encaptured me, I could see a visage etched into the pillar now, two chipped away eyes and a cracked and fiendish smile. Unaware of my doubts, my men look to me, ready to dig out the rubble on my command, eager to find any treasures that may lay beneath our feet."
 sjalvolki_conquest.0122.a:0 "Unwise to disturb places like this, we should move on."

Taking stock of the situation my eyes are quickly drawn to the fighter the rest of my men are staring at in awe, a lone warrior standing atop a pile of the freshly slain, covered in blood and breathing heavily with two viscously curved axes held loosely in his massive hands. He joined our company alongside a small band of oath-sworn Sjalvolki a month ago, but this is the first time I've been able to witness his savage skill in action. A real live Sjalvolki berserker in our midst - I never thought I'd see the day."

 sjalvolki_conquest.0127.desc:0 "The sight of an Aversarian in full armor riding down one of our company puts my stomach in a lurch. Even from the distance at which I am observing the thunder of hooves is frighteningly loud, and I feel sick realizing I am too far away to help our comrade. Just as I am certain his death is imminent, something whistles violently past my left ear and the Aversarian  Hipparanopehi suddenly goes stiff in his saddle, an arrow blooming from his visor. He topples, almost crashing atop his shocked would-be victim, and his horse gallops aimlessly away.\n\nTurning to look behind me I see the strange woman who joined us some days ago. She is now standing triumphantly, carefully unstringing and stowing her elegantly curved bow as she looks with obvious satisfaction at her handiwork. With her leather helmet now strung on her belt, I can see from the feathers woven into her tightly braided hair that she is a well-proven Sarminian warrior, and likely just as deadly with the broad-bladed spear she carries as she is with her bow. Many songs have been sung of the prowess of these warrior women, and she would surely prove an invaluable asset."

 sjalvolki_conquest.0128.desc:0 "The small group of Mondecny who joined us a few weeks ago have quickly proven themselves invaluable assets to our party. At first my soldiers viewed them with suspicion, a prejudice not helped by their insistence to camp at a distance from us, and their clear avoidance of direct confrontation with the foe. Attitudes began to change when our meager rations were suddenly supplemented by them delivering dozens of braces of rabbits as if from nowhere, and their demonstration that a number of local tubers and roots are perfectly edible - and delicious - when cooked. When their scouting alerted us to an Aversarian ambush which would have been certain death had we wandered into it unawares, the strange Portenchants - whom we now know as Moonkin - were transformed into figures of admiration in the camp literally overnight.\n\nSome of my clansmen are prompting me to now approach their leader to make this alliance permanent."

Tensions dissipate when he hefts a heavy bag at my feet, spilling silver goblets and jewelry upon the ground and begins to speak in an unexpectedly eloquent voice. He offers to help us pillage and loot the Aversarian countryside - an art in which he is a proven expert - if we cut him in a share of the spoils. He tells us that his own band were, until a few days ago, happily doing the same before they ran into a superior force of locals, a fight from which he was the only survivor."

When they broke down the gates the only humans they found within were a handful of caretaker slaves who had apparently been locked inside when the owner of this opulent estate fled.\n\nThe interior is a complex of massive cages, pits, and rectangular ponds holding all manner of strange beasts - many of which have been driven to excitement and terror by the noise of the city being sacked outside the walls. Some we recognize: wolves, bears, and a stable of beautifully bred horses. Others are complete mysteries: strangely built men covered in coarse dark hair who howl wordlessly at me when I approach their cage, birds with feathers the color of jewels, and an odd creature built like a horse but with a neck longer than the height of three men, and a single jewel-like horn crowning its skull. Most impressively of all however is the mammoth. While known to us in story and song, such giants were thought lost when the fog consumed our homeland. My men are already eagerly divvying up the spoils, and waiting for me to stake out a claim on my share of the loot."

The druids do not even deign to halt their ritual. In an instant I realize that I may have stumbled into something far more serious than I anticipated. I have no choice but to defend myself!"

 sjalvolki_conquest.0144.desc:0 "Messengers from two clans have come to me over the past few days, each denouncing the other and claiming that only they have legitimate rights to the golden statue discovered in a looted manor. They request my assistance in determining the true owner, as I happened to be passing through the area. The statue in question was apparently discovered by warriors from one clan, who had routed an enemy force guarding it and rushed into the manor, leaving the other to finish the battle. Attempts to have the envoys speak to each other have ended in violence, with my guards having to pull one off of the other, both shouting about how the other was dishonoring themselves through deceit. They have each beseeched me to settle the conflict in their favour. The tribe who initially took the statue have offered a share of the other loot they took, while the tribe that finished the battle have offered to have it melted down and the gold split between them."
 sjalvolki_conquest.0144.a:0 "Take the bribe, the gold is probably worth more than the statue."
 sjalvolki_conquest.0144.b:0 "Fostering cooperation will look better. Melt it down and split it."

 sjalvolki_conquest.0145.desc:0 "My troops have brought an Aversarian magi before me, having captured [aversarian_magi.GetHerHim] in the heat of battle. While [aversarian_magi.GetSheHe] was flinging spells at my army, a small force snuck up behind [aversarian_magi.GetHerHim] and knocked [aversarian_magi.GetHerHim] unconscious. They now kneel before me, hands bound, speaking in broken [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName]. 'P-please, spare me. I am [aversarian_magi.GetName]. I can serve you, great lord. I have great power.' Tears are beginning to run down [aversarian_magi.GetHerHis] face as [aversarian_magi.GetSheHe] looks up at me. [aversarian_magi.GetHerHis] offer is, at first, tempting, with Aversarian magi being famed for their power. However, [aversarian_magi.GetSheHe] was caught while resisting my troops and perhaps deserves execution instead. Of course, I could always spare [aversarian_magi.GetHerHim], but leave [aversarian_magi.GetHerHim] powerless, surely a punishment that would make any Aversarian weep."
 sjalvolki_conquest.0145.a:0 "This wretch deserves no mercy. Hand me my sword!"

 sjalvolki_conquest.0146.desc:0 "As my troops storm over the walls, the defenders fleeing before us, my troops begin to greedily eye everything they see. Slowly at first, and then in larger groups as more and more enemies fall, soldiers begin to break ranks, brandishing weapons as they run through the streets to the screams of the city’s inhabitants. I see one of my troops kick open a door and cut down the people sheltering behind it, as another begins stripping the possessions of a cowering merchant. By the time the final defenders have been killed, order is beginning to break down in the streets. As a torch is raised to what appears to be a wealthy man’s home, and ignites the building, I realize that I have to do something. The troops will love me if I let them plunder as they wish, but I also run the risk of completely losing control of them."

The burnt-out shells of buildings mark where people once lived their lives. Soldiers slumber in random places, all order having broken down in the sack. As I step over a corpse, I see two of my followers engaged in a duel, seemingly fighting over a pouch of gold stolen from one of the city's former inhabitants. Victory has been achieved, however this settlement is now effectively useless to us. The few refugees will surely spread tales of how we are every bit the barbarians they believe us to be, and it will take some time to whip the soldiers back into shape."
