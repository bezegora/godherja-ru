They stole the gift of magic from man, and in response to their provocations, the First Men tamed and enslaved the dragons, using them in battle until finally hunting the last free dragons into extinction and putting down their flock.\n\nWhether or not the tale is true, the Drakavil remains, filled with the bones of the legendary creatures. For a thousand years hence, the tomb has remained under the watch of the Red Guard, who ensure that the dragons remain content in their deathly slumber. And thankfully, there they shall surely remain ever vigilant, ensuring that nobody meddles with things best left dead. Surely."

 building_type_kasmeze_cathedral_01_desc:0 "Who originally built the great Citadel at Kasmeze and its attached temple is a question that still has no definitive answer. Most scholars agree that the site benefited greatly from Emperor Partharian's patronage starting around 200, but debates are still ongoing as to whether he had actually built the core of the structure, or Mountain-Sun Temple splinter factions as has been suggested numerous times. In any case, it would quickly become one of the greatest and most prosperous pilgrimage sites of the south, and the Aagiokratia in general, in the following two centuries - even rivaling the likes of the Vounill and Thebastro.\n\nIts stint as a major spiritual center would come to a rapid end in the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], however, as it was first defiled by Count Themos for an arcane ritual in 503, and then further stripped of any valuables by the desperate, penniless governorate of Opakhasia a few decades later. By the end of the crisis, it was but a fire gutted ruin, and due to the general economic decline of the region, it was largely abandoned to its fate.\n\nIn 1147, reconstruction of the building was planned, but was met with delay upon delay until it finally began in 1184. Of course, this brief bout of optimism was soon dispelled as Aversaria descended into the [imperial_civil_war|E] and the site abandoned yet again, its restoration half finished."

This has allowed the Cathedral to double both as a place of worship and a place to train new warriors of the faith.

While the area it is located in had been explored prior to its discovery, the shrine by all accounts seems to have more or less suddenly appeared in the mid 900s IS. While initially thought to have been built by a strange cult or spirits, Aversarian archaeologists would later date the site through fossil and spiritual study to roughly 699 BE.\n\nIt is unknown where the shrine has come from, but Aversarian attempts to cross the lava field proved fruitless. Any attempted bridge projects failed spectacularly, through constant accidents from the slave workforce or magical back-casting. By all accounts, the site seems cursed, any attempt to reach it doomed to failure from bad luck more than seemingly any magic in the site itself.\n\nCenware 'Witch-Breaker' and his refugee army would rediscover the site over a hundred years since it had passed from Aversarian interest while journeying west. The Sjalvolki stayed well clear of it, believing it cursed, though legends say that the Partic Seers somehow managed to cross into it with little issue and would never speak of what they saw there after."

Corpulent, greedy and exceptionally hedonistic, Kresox's bitter refusal to show even the basic traits of leadership led to his constant damaging of the war effort and the failure of any organized response to the invasion.\n\nWhen Kresox came to the ancient shrine in this spot to meet with the Witch-Breaker, he had his personal guard turn on his lieutenants and had them brought to Cenware in chains. Kresox offered his generals as slaves, along with the armies, in return for the right to keep his slaves.\n\nThe Witch-Breaker agreed to the offer, and Kresox signed an official declaration ordering the Legions of Kalathipsomi (II 'Proudest', IX 'Purety', IIV 'Valor' and XVII 'Pathos') to surrender themselves to the Witch-Breaker immediately. Once the agreement was signed, Cenware ordered Kresox's slaves brought forth so that they may be returned to the Legon, and then had Kresox stripped and thrown to the mass, informing the slaves that the Legon had been returned to them as requested to do as they wished. As Kresox was beaten to death, the Witch-Breaker informed the surrendered legionary's that he formally freed them from their slavery, and ordered them to return to their homes and learn crafts other than war.
