At first, it was the persistent nightmares, then it was the disappearing peasants, and now that an ominous mist rises, it can no longer be denied - the [fog|E] is creeping upon our lands.\n\nThough still livable, the land has already begun to suffer. Both nobles and smallfolk alike have been frantically gathering what possessions they can and making for greener pastures, while the ghoulish denizens of the [fog|E] have begun descending upon the unprotected and foolish."

They speak nonsense, lies, LIES, all of them they LIE.\n\nThe infernal chittering can't get out of my head even when I sleep but I don't sleep because it always wants me to Listen chitter but but it wants to say the chitterchitter truth Listen truth chitter but it lies and I want want the truth yes the truth yes yes yes yesyesyes"

Anyone remaining there by this point is either dead, corrupted, or brave beyond possibility - and also soon to be dead or corrupted.\n\nThough I still nominally hold the province, it has entirely slipped out of my control, and is now a hellish wasteland controlled by those vile abominations that skulk within the [fog|E]."
