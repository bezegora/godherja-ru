After deposing what had become seen as an incompetent and corrupt regency council that had held complete control of the country for nearly 150 years, the Unitarians established an effective republic. One where only the landed may vote, and the chancellor serves for life. By all accounts, the Popular Revolution was less a revolution and more the minor nobility taking power away from the larger estate holders who controlled the regency council.\n\nThe Unitarians remain popular among the lower classes and many nobles alike, and the faction advocates for a continuation of the 'republican' system."
