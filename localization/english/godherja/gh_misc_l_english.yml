This has been a controversial decision with the nobility, who see the commoners' ability to choose their own path as a violation of their rights and a threat to their way of life, but with the Wayfather's of Chevalie in agreement there is little to be done.\n\nWhile the nobility bicker and complain, the peasantry have largely taken to celebration, though most will still no doubt pointedly encourage their children to follow the Way of Harvests."

The old man was a hero to us all, a living legend, and with his death we sit confused and lost. Who is our enemy? Who would see him dead? Truth be told, the list of suspects is great. Few [aversarian|E]s were fond of his message of peace with non-humans, or of the destruction of the [magi|E] caste, but to resort to such means? Who am I kidding, that's the most [aversarian|E] move of all.\n\nBut who? We must know, we need to know. Not only for Valerix's memory, but for our own guidance. We must find our enemy, and we must destroy them. There can be no other recourse.\n\nI have assembled a force to investigate this immediately. It's time we begin asking questions, and preparing our blades."

eastern_reforms.0002.title:0 "A Governor's Word"
eastern_reforms.0002.desc:0 "Governor Tetradia, effeminate as always, strides into my quarters smelling of a dozen different perfumes that no doubt cost more than an entire cohorts armor.\n\n"Legan," he starts, clearly doubting the worth of such a title, "Your investigators have been hounding me. I tire of it, I have information for you. Take it and kill your enemies, and then give me back my city."\n\nCommon words from him, but the scroll he drops before me has actually useful information. Movements from Öltenic tribesmen under secrecy, all towards the west. Several desertions from new recruits from eastern tribes shortly after the Valerix's death, and the report from the physicians who investigated Valerix's body reporting poison only created in the far east..."

eastern_reforms.0003.desc:0 "Khatan Altan of the Kteumaxa tribe has sent me a rider, and a series of letters dictated by himself with notes added by several of my Öltenic vassals.\n\nThe letter describes a second narrative to the death of Legon Valerix. Attempts to bribe him and his clansmen by mysterious agents speaking in [aversarian|E] accents, Valerix's Öltenic guard of the night not deserting but disappearing shortly after, a woman who was otherwise renowned for her loyalty and honor. Finally, a similar accusation of eastern poison, but instead a note that the seller of which had been captured, and had given the information that the poison was shipped to our port by a third party before committing suicide...\n\nAltan states in the letter that he has no wish to make assumptions on my account, but tells me that the culprit is likely one within my own court..."

I will take each one as I drive the dagger into their hearts, for the memory of Valerix must be avenged.\n\nTetradia has sent a token force and coin to assist in the endeavor, hardly any worth mentioning.

Valerix's honored spirit stands with us, as do the Öltenic, and it is by my name and the honor of my Legion that neither will be done shame."

His personal guard - a force of Kikarsag mercenaries - lie dead or sit with swords to their back, having surrendered in the final moments of battle. Around us, his personal estate burns, and I watch as my men slowly escort his slaves out of the premises, the signs of long abuse and torture visible on their half-starved frames.\n\nThe sight of this... to say it fills me with anger would be underselling it, and I drive my blade into Tetradia's thigh as he lets out a high pitched scream.\n\n"Admit it, and I won't make this more painful than it has to be, Tetradia."\n\nThe man whimpers again, and I twist the blade as my men and his watch solemnly. Another scream, and then he nods through tears.\n\n"I did it, damn you! The fool was going to damn us all! Freed slaves? Ridding us of the [magi|E]? The man was an idiot! And so are you, you fucking lowborn whore!"\n\nThe blade is dragged from his thigh slowly, and I sigh.\n\n"My mother was the whore, Tetradia, I am the Legan." With one swift motion, Tetradia's head is lopped off his shoulders, and rolls down the ancient mosaic of his manor, blood filling the gaps.\n\nWith Tetradia dead, Valerix is avenged, and our bond with the Öltenic is forged. Now is the time to see Valerix's dream through, and prepare for the reconquest."

Freed slaves, Öltenic tribesmen, volunteers from across the east. Before us stands the gates of Asiupoli, the great city glimmering in the wastes, even in its ruined post-Frodbrokna state.\n\nThe Fenvir are not to be discounted, and we will need bravery, skill, and cunning to defeat them. It wouldn't hurt to have more help as well, and the Öltenic have promised their aid in return for their claims in Ephesos.

eastern_reforms.0100.title:0 "A Governor's Death"
eastern_reforms.0100.desc:0 "Governor Tetradia was, through and through, a haughty, foppish, and cowardly man, but something could certainly be said about his knack for survival. Through a combination of cunning and simple luck, he managed to survive the schemings of the Imperial court, the Frodbrokna, and the incursions of the Fenvir, scratching his way to the top of the rubble as the world burned around him.\n\nI may never know if he was a simple schemer and opportunist or a villain masterminding Valerix's assassination. One thing is certain, however. His luck has run out.\n\nGovernor Tetradia is dead, and with him dies his dream of returning to Asiupoli."
eastern_reforms.0100.a:0 "I may never know the truth..."

eastern_reforms.0101.title:0 "A Vengeance Unrealised"
eastern_reforms.0101.desc:0 ""Fuck!"\n\nThe rat-tongued, gutless murderer of the Legon has made his final betrayal--this time cheating me of my opportunity to put him to the sword.\n\nIn the company of my men I joke that I will reinstate the magi if they can revive Tetradia for me to kill a second time, but I cannot hide the rage behind my words.\n\nThere is a hole in my heart where Valerix once resided, and each beat fills me with an unslakable bloodlust."
eastern_reforms.0101.a:0 "Thank the Purest I didn't get to you first, Tetradia!"

reform_aversarian_religion_desc:0 "For too long has the homeland been locked in a neverending series of back and forth attrocities. It is our duty to stop this, by ending the magocracy, and radically altering what it truly means to be an [aversarian|E].\n\nTo give merit to what we preach, we will need to hold one of the holiest sites of the old faith in our grasp, as well as make a show of strength to impress all. Aeschres' feral lap dog, Gorassos, and his obscene bloody throne embody the worst cruelties of the old way, and taking the Skull-Taker's own skull is sure to turn more than a few heads."
reform_aversarian_religion_reform_effect:0 "We will reform the [aversarian|E] faith to a more compassionate, inclusive creed."

black_sun.0002.title:0 "Pronounce Myself an Incarnation of the Purest"
black_sun.0002.desc:0 "The Omitiloi of the realm have convened to weigh my claims, sequestering themselves for the night in prayer and contemplation. At the crack of dawn, they emerged and made their proclamation; I am the Purest incarnate.\n\nAfter all, where else could my strategies have come from? Who else could have steered my sword as I slaughtered barbarian defilers? How else could I have been blessed with victory upon victory? No, there is no other explanation than divine inspiration—no, divine incartation.\n\nLet the priests believe what they may, as long as they tell my soldiers to worship me by spilling heathen blood. Call me god-made-flesh, as long as you obey my every command. And kiss the banner of the Black Sun as much as you want, as long as it flies over every city of the Empire once more."
black_sun.0002.a:0 "Worship or not, as long as you obey."

eastern_reforms.0013.title:0 "The Eastern Reforms"
eastern_reforms.0013.desc:0 "Today marks a new day for [aversaria|E]. With the most controversial scholars dragged out of wherever they had once lived and plenty more writing the new scriptures at spearpoint, a new and better religion begins today. One which ends the magocracy, greatly pulls back our reliance on slavery, and greatly loosens the strict restrictions on who can be considered [aversarian|E].\n\nOur bretheren will no doubt fight this change with tooth and nail, but whether it takes a decade or a century, [aversaria|E] shall be born anew!"
