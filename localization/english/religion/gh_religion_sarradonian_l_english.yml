The [wardenites|E] believe that the evil of the world originates with this Dead God, who He Who Was imprisoned and charged humanity with keeping sealed away at all costs. This prison is said to be made of a series of 'pillars', which many [wardenite|E] sects interpret as spiritual virtues. Fail to uphold these virtues, they believe, and the Dead God shall roam free once more."

 sarradonian_adj:0 "Wardenite"
 sarradonian_adherent:0 "Wardenite"
 sarradonian_adherent_plural:0 "Wardenites" 
 sarradonian_desc:0 "The mainstream [wardenite|E] sect has been locked in centuries of struggle; first with the [ritualists|E], then with the Agionists and other [aversarian|E] invaders. This constant threat has not inspired unity, but instead sowed division. Multiple heretical movements, seeing the faithful as incapable of being virtuous enough to uphold their interpretation of the pillars, have broken off and forged their own paths."

 harthahi_desc:0 "The Harthahi sect was created in response to perceived [wardenite|E] weakness, and a belief that the [wardenite|E] sects are too tolerant of outsiders. The Harthahii argue that the Dead God is imprisoned within [sarradon|E], and that all evil done upon its land is a direct attempt to unleash them back upon the world. Thus, [sarradon|E] must be free, and its people united against those the Harthahii view as foreign invaders - namely the Agionists, [aversarians|E], and Marchers."

 ruidari_adherent_plural:0 "Ruidarii"
 ruidari_desc:0 "The Ruidarii uphold the 'Pillar of Inclusion,' the idea that if one commits a good deed, it doesn't matter if the deed is done in the name of a false god, it still upholds the Pillars of Virtue that keep the Dead God imprisoned. This means to a Ruidari, one’s faith is almost completely divorced from their deeds, because practicing ‘good deeds’ is seen as service to keep the Dead God imprisoned."

 kathsiti_desc:0 "The Kathsitii, unlike other [wardenite|E] sects believe that there must be complete separation between the church and state, for secular matters corrupt the true spiritual nature of the church. In reality this has led to an extremely independent, politically powerful group of Kathsiti clerics dictating rules to secular lords."

 harfi_desc:0 "The Harfii, unlike other [wardenite|E] sects believe that the 'Pillars of Virtue' are actual, physical pillars that can be found in the material world, and must be protected. The other [wardenite|E] sects dismiss this interpetation as comically literal, and view any unironic adherents of the Harfi ways as backwards fundamentalists."

 haradar_adj:0 "Haradar"

 haradar_adherent_plural:0 "Haradarii"
 haradar_desc:0 "A [sarradonian|E] legend says ten-thousand years ago, the warlords of [sarradon|E] fell to decadence and wickedness, and the Pillars holding the Dead God in Iblis had begun to crumble. When all seemed lost, brave and righteous men emerged from the Shadows to cull these false warlords, and disappeared once again into the shadows. Whether this legend is true or not, the Haradarii have had several foundings and disbandings over the millenia, to the point that nobody truly knows how old the order of assassins is. The most recent founding occurred not long after [frodbrokna|E]. This new founding has concluded that after Aeschraes broke the world, no magi can be allowed to live. They are concerned primarily with the hunting down and assassination of magi, especially those with godlike power."
