 aerasodiax_desc:0 "The Aesodiaxyn faith is the worship of Aersodiax, the Speaker of Gods and the first leader of humans. Tales say that Aersodiax was a cruel but wise king, who ruled over humanity and taught them the ways of [magic|E] in return for blood and servitude. Aersodiax was a tyrant, but to those who were loyal offered great reward, and was the only link humanity had to the Creator, the deity who created the world.\n\nAersodiax cursed humanity after a great rebellion where Aersodiax and his dynasty were killed, and it is the duty of all who still follow them to appease their spirit through constant offerings and rituals aiming for their forgiveness. If they do so, Aersodiax may grant them the ability to survive rituals of purity, allowing them to use the gift of [magic|E] he once commanded."
