 innovation_imperial_magic:0 "[mayikprolollan|E] Education"
 innovation_imperial_magic_desc:0 "From across the [aversarian|E] Empire those children who displayed a promising talent for magic were sent to one of the great magical academies of the Empire. Above all stood the [mayikprolollan|E], its halls producing generations of some of the most powerful [magi|E] in history."
 
 innovation_anti_magic_combat:0 "Anti-Magic Combat Techniques"
 innovation_anti_magic_combat_desc:0 "Whilst the world around the Marcher Kingdoms embraced magic and the promise of unlimited power it offered, the Marchers see magic as the unrivaled danger it really is. By training our finest warriors in the art of nullifying magic and cutting down those who wield it, our enemies will be robbed of their most potent weapons."
 
 innovation_saraddonian_elephantry:0 "War Elephants"
 innovation_saraddonian_elephantry_desc:0 "Elephants are difficult to raise in captivity, so each ambitious young man must capture their own wild elephants and train them. This means there is a delicate art to properly using these great creatures in battle, but it is an art we are dedicated to mastering."
 
 innovation_saraddonian_camels:0 "War Camels"
 innovation_saraddonian_camels_desc:0 "Camels are naturally suited for living in desert terrain, but they aren't inherently creatures of battle. Our breeders and trainers can change this, giving us access to adaptive cavalry which will let us master the sands."
 
 innovation_berserkers:0 "Spirit of the Bear"
 innovation_berserkers_desc:0 "From the forests, hills and mountains of the Sjalvolki tribes come those few warriors unmatched by any other. Championed by their clansmen, feared by their enemies, these 'Berserkers' channel a fury unrelenting on the battlefield. Often identified by their massive fur cloaks, few cross these warriors and live to tell the tale."
 
 innovation_chariots:0 "Spoked Wheels"
 innovation_chariots_desc:0 "Across the battlefields of the Empire, the deafening roar of Vhanavid Chariots charging towards them are capable of making even the toughest veteran's hands shake around their weapon. Capable of both smashing through enemy lines and picking off foes from range, by adopting the rising strategy of deploying chariots in one great thrust rather than piecemeal our armies will surely reduce the battle lines of any enemy to a chaotic rabble."
 
 innovation_regular_magic:0 "Magic" #placeholder
 innovation_regular_magic_desc:0 "Present since the beginning of time, Magic has been prevalent throughout the realms of all. When harnessed, Magic has the power to bring about bountiful boons or unthinkable ruin."
 
 innovation_wodes:0 "Fog Magic"
 innovation_wodes_desc:0 "Dismissed by many as mindless savages, the Fogeaters have displayed a surprising amount of cunning and innovation of late. Recent developments have seen strange new breeds of these mutated humans emerging from the fog, likely the final result of mages who have been unfortunate enough to survive the effects of the Fog. They often glow with an unnatural light, seem to react as if using their own magic is painful, and are without exception utterly insane."
 
 innovation_grave_wardens:0 "Oejeynica Frontier Outposts"
 innovation_grave_wardens_desc:0 "The survival of the Ojyczaynz has prompted many to return to their ancient traditions, one of which is that of Grave Wardens who once guarded the necropolis-complexes of Ojyczaynz cities. Elite and carrying only the heaviest plate, the dead and living both can not resist their legendary charge. They gather at the various outposts at the edges of their people's territory, forever doing battle with the [undead|E] they once protected."
 
 innovation_flying_lances:0 "Towarzysz"
 innovation_flying_lances_desc:0 "Proud reminders of the Golden Age of the Ojyczaynz, the Flying Lances carry on the ancient cavalry culture of their people. Influenced by the knights of the Marches, they travel across villages still following the culture and offer their aid against bandits and the [undead|E] both. In times of great need, they form elite cavalry units. Legends say that the wings they hold on their back were once not ornamental, in a time when their people still carried the gift of magic."
 
 innovation_golden_spears:0 "Lessons of the Golden City"
 innovation_golden_spears_desc:0 "The advanced society of the mighty Empire of Adabyss, always looking both inwards and outwards needs obedience in order to thrive. The Golden Spears are the model Adabyssian. Strong, professional and a reflection of the selfless service the Empire they represent demands. There is honour and glory in victory, and many victories have been won by their spears on all fronts of the Empire."  
 
 innovation_adabyss:0 "Cutting edge of Adabyss"
 innovation_adabyss_desc:0 "The pace at which Abadyss advances puts the nations of the north to shame. While magi bicker and shatter continents, the Adabyssians soar the sky in never before seen ships. Power has been centralized through the quick training of crossbowmen that let loose bolts that fly with a speed heard of only in the myths of old. Huge shimmering Golden Statues walk alongside the armies of the Emperor causing untold destruction to anyone who would dare oppose them. These technological marvels have caused the Empire to have a highly centralized military and have made the average lord laughably weak in comparison to the glory of the Emperor's legions."
 
 innovation_veiled:0 "Veiled"
 innovation_veiled_desc:0 "They say that in better times the Gestanwoder Magi gathered only in secret, enacting foul rites to commune with the unspeakable. They say they now know the names of all the things that should not be, almost were, and could never be. That they have communed with alien spirits and learned exquisite cruelties from an age beyond memory. And now, in our triumph they practice all of this in the open, inflicting nightmares upon the world. \n \n A constant flow of living captives are led deep into the most forlorn reaches of our swamps. The few that leave do not do so as men. Beside our armies lurch abominations of heaving, tortured muscle, fused forms that were unmistakably once human. Even our own soldiers have trouble looking at them without becoming nauseous, and have taken to tying rough veils over the organs which were clearly once faces."
 
 innovation_the_bloodied:0 "Iyrossi Raiders"
 innovation_the_bloodied_desc:0 "The arrogance of the Aversarians has led them to assume that a slave revolt could never overwhelm a local garrison, no matter how poorly equipped. Perhaps this was the case in ages past, but it's become clear that our tyrants have no idea what terrible forces their venal negligence has unleashed. As months have turned to years, and years to decades the ragtag bands of escaped slaves have learned to fight, transforming from refugees to hardened fighters adept in the art of guerilla warfare and terror raiding against the fat and lazy Aversarians. They deluded themselves, thinking they could break the immortal spirit of the Iyrossi by chaining and demeaning us, never expecting there would ever be a time they would have to pay restitution. \n \n Now is the time of vengeance."
 
 innovation_prophets_sons:0 "Foreign Anti-Magic Techniques"
 innovation_prophets_sons_desc:0 "Where Marcher mercenaries go, their [antimagic|E] techniques soon follow. Their art is so sought after that it has become common for companies of soldiers to bring trunkloads of pictorial manuals from their homeland to sell along with their services, and those who are skilled enough themselves often moonlight as instructors for paying clients. An increasing number of noble families have recently taken to keeping one or two Marcher teachers as permanent staff to tutor their children."
 
 innovation_marcher_knights:0 "Chivalric Codes"
 innovation_marcher_knights_desc:0 "The Marches have of late been in the throes of a veritable literary and cultural renaissance. New ballads, books on romance, manuals on choosing Paths, and the ever present attempt by the more ambitious WayPriests to get the peasants to learn their letters is sweeping the country. This new era sees both a new slate of sumptuary laws, as well as further restrictions on the conduct considered to be appropriate for a knight fighting his fellow PathWalkers. There's even been an attempt to canonize a smaller code of conduct for fighting non-Marchers, but this has been controversial and only haltingly adopted."
 
 innovation_brother_riders:0 "Blood Oaths"
 innovation_brother_riders_desc:0 "The Sjalvolki culture developed in the cold and misty forests of the continental interior. Now that they have emerged onto the continent's warm and rich coasts, their culture has begun to undergo radical changes. Whereas different tribes would formerly only cross paths to contest for territory, their newfound cosmopolitan environment has begun to create a much stronger Pan-Sjalvolki identity. Most emblematic of this shift is the increasing popularity of blood oaths among adventurous young men. Whilst in centuries past this practice was usually only undertaken by men who already shared fairly close knit communities, it's become common to see oaths bonded between individuals hailing from tribes on complete opposite ends of the Sjalvolki world."
 
 innovation_moonkin:0 "Moon Rituals"
 innovation_moonkin_desc:0 "Pale Aervalr, ensconced precariously within the branches of Stoðrusigga, has always been of deep spiritual importance in Allemani culture. Despite repeated attempts at suppression and co-option by the Aversarians the MoonKin - a broad association of fraternal and sororal orders with a heritage going back over a millenia in Mondecny culture - have now begun to resurface. Broadly peaceful, their rituals and practices intended to steward and protect the natural world are also rather useful for producing top quality scouts and skirmishers should our people be forced to fight for our survival. \n \n May the Gods shelter us from that day ever coming to pass."
 
 innovation_konijkmener_pikes:0 "Urban Militias"
 innovation_konijkmener_pikes_desc:0 "A proud tradition predating the Popular Revolution, over the centuries the Konijkmener have written a mammoth corpus of text relating to the proper user of pikes in warfare, as well as the proper way to muster and manage an army composed of and largely run by the commoners. Every man, and in some instances woman of sound body, is drafted on a lottery system to serve in the local militia and learn the basics of military service. Despite De Kanzerlerij's small size, the Republic has been able to produce shockingly large and well trained armies on surprisingly short notice to resist threats."
 
 innovation_partic_seers:0 "Wayline Knowledge"
 innovation_partic_seers_desc:0 "When The Witch-Breaker took the [mayikprolollan|E] he distributed the Imperial Magi's ill-gotten gains among his coalition's seers and shamans. Poring over these tomes has allowed us to fill in substantial gaps in our knowledge, especially relating to the so called [sea_tower|E] and its associated [tower_wayline|E]. Combining our own expertise with that of a millennia of Aversarian Magi gives us an almost unmatched potential."
 
 innovation_aversarian_legionaires:0 "Aversarian Plate"
 innovation_aversarian_legionaires_desc:0 "Developments in metallurgy during the 14th century have propelled the re-forming Aversarian legions to a new standard. Our soldiers now benefit both from better protection, but also lighter armor. We have not only begun to catch up to the pre-Frodbrokna Aautokrata, but in some areas have now surpassed it!"
 
 innovation_griffon_riders:0 "Griffon Breeding Techniques"
 innovation_griffon_riders_desc:0 "Griffon breeding has always been a tricky business. They grow slowly, are picky about mates, rarely give birth to more than two cubs at a time, and only half of those cubs which are born survive to adulthood. In the late 13th century however, techniques first developed within the Anti-Magic chapterhouses in the Western Bastione Mountains began to work their way into broader Marcher society. Beds heated with water piping, diets fortified with ewe's blood, and new and more robust griffon bloodlines rapidly transformed griffon breeding into something a little more reliable and affordable for the nobility at large."
 
 innovation_bloodbound:0 "Bloodbound"
 innovation_bloodbound_desc:0 "The sudden and miraculous revival of the Iyrossi nation after centuries of oppression has resulted in both a newfound interest in the old faith and traditions of their ancestors and a growing anger at just how much Iyrossi culture Aversaria succeeded in eradicating. These two tendencies have combined into a new warrior cult dedicated to Deiphartoros that seeks to wield this newfound unity in a crusade of bloody vengeance against the tyrants who made their ancestors suffer so greatly."
 
 innovation_legion_raiders:0 "Legion Raiders"
 innovation_legion_raiders_desc:0 "The protection provided by the Iyrossi basin has meant that the Aversarians stationed there have had to contend with far fewer armed threats over the centuries than their counterparts elsewhere. Instead the threat has usually come from within, slave revolts and desperate runaways being something of an occupational hazard when running a slave colony. Since their opponents have universally lacked in both training and equipment the garrisons have foregone the standard heavy armor of the Aversarian Legions in favor of lighter cloth and leather armor variants. They may have a reputation in other provinces for being soft, but these so called Raiders certainly strike dread into the hearts of the terrorized Iyrossi at the mere sight of their black banners."
 
 innovation_home_legions:0 "Home Legionnaires"
 innovation_home_legions_desc:0 "An often overlooked cause of Aversaria's rise was its reserve army, garrisoned in cities and fortresses across the Aautokrata's heartland. During times of extreme crisis these Home Legionnaires often served as the last line of defense. While never afforded quite the same level of arms and armor as their brethren in the more traditional legions, they still benefited from training that would put other Continental armies to shame."
 
 innovation_pure_pikes:0 "Pikes of the Purest"
 innovation_pure_pikes_desc:0 "To hear the lords of Opakhasia tell it, the Illustrious Sun-Crowned Brotherhood of the Pikes of the Purest are an ancient and deadly institution dating back to the days before Aversaria overtook the Mountain-Sun Temple. They claim that these men are the mightiest soldiers in the Aautokrata, whose impenetrable golden armor bears the blessing of the Purest himself. \n \n These are, of course, pretenses. The gold is a thin layer of gilding over mundane iron, and their pristine white uniforms the product of excessive bleaching. The Aironoi snicker that the Opakhasians have even had to start recruiting barbarian mercenaries to fill the ranks. Regardless of these indignities, the Opakhasians do still benefit from an indisputably effective military tradition of pike warfare going back a millennia, and the often overlooked morale benefits of good uniform design. Despite being a prohibitive expense that modern Opakhasia can barely afford to field, they can still win battles."
 
 innovation_legion_outriders:0 "Legion Outriders"
 innovation_legion_outriders_desc:0 "The open steppe of Eastern Aversaria have always been a difficult land for the Aautokrata to control. Many of the barbarian tribes who inhabit this inhospitable land simply choose to disappear over the horizon rather than face a Legion in open battle, returning once the army has withdrawn to resume raiding and pillaging. Worse, swaths of the land is still woefully underdeveloped and unfit for traditional farming resulting in a settler population who often dabble in nomadism themselves. These two factors allow us to recruit some of the best light horsemen in the civilized world, raised in the saddle from birth and tutored in the ways of steppe warfare by its barbarian masters."
 
 innovation_north_shields:0 "Shields of the North"
 innovation_north_shields_desc:0 "The Apokiakas have always been considered a strange people by their Aversarian siblings to the south. They say they're not quite Aversarian any more, with bloodlines polluted with traces of Kardwen, Karzarad, and even Sjalvolki. The Apokiakas would say that their southern cousins are soft, and could never hope to survive even a single winter on the harsh frontier. They've learned how to live and fight from their barbarian neighbors, far from the comforts of the warm southern seas."
 
 innovation_legion_marines:0 "Marine Legions"
 innovation_legion_marines_desc:0 "The empire's lifeblood is its maritime trade, and where there is blood to be found there are leeches. The Shattered coast, with its countless islands and bays is a perfect environment for the growth and spread of piracy. There are some historians who claim that the earliest of the Marine Legions were actually pirates themselves, captured and given the chance to buy back their lives at the cost of service. Whatever the case may be, they quickly proved instrumental as the Marine Legions helped shatter the navies of several of Aversaria's maritime rivals."
 
 innovation_duneriders:0 "Duneriders"
 innovation_duneriders_desc:0 "The Aversarian way of life just doesn't work in the desert. It's been tried and many have died, but it's too fragile. Even without the threat of Sarradonian raiders there are vast regions that are impossible to effectively irrigate using current technology. Most of the colonists seem to inevitably adopt the more nomadic lifestyles common to the local inhabitants, adopting the bizarre animals native to the southern continent known as 'Camels'."
 
 innovation_stepwalkers:0 "Stepwalkers"
 innovation_stepwalkers_desc:0 "Despite the attrition of the [war_in_heaven|E] and the disastrous near extinction of [magi|E] on the continent from [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E], the ancient traditions of magic still persist in Sarradon. Radically alien to the traditions for magical practitioners in Aversaria, the StepWalkers are not a specific school or tradition but instead a blanket term referring to over five hundred identified practices and cults. Some groups make the dubious claim to a history going back over a thousand years - and a few might even be telling the truth."
 
 innovation_eastern_cav:0 "Kikarsag Riders of the East"
 innovation_eastern_cav_desc:0 "When the Aversarians provided the Kikarsags with access to high quality and abundant iron for the first time in their history, it had a rapid and far reaching effect on the tribe's society. Where once their armies relied on the traditional horse archer cavalry of their cousins deeper in the steppe, now their nobility ride into battle wearing as much metal as their horses can support. Years of riding into battle at the beck and call of their Aversarian masters has given the experience needed to master the art of smashing an army with a well timed charge. Now it is Aversaria's turn to know the terror of hearing the distant thunder of iron-shod hooves."
 
 
 #Non MAA Culture Specific 
 
 innovation_doriosian_reforms:0 "Doriosian Reforms"
 innovation_doriosian_reforms_desc:0 "Before his death at the Battle of the Elysian Pass, Legon Dorios was the pioneer behind an ambitious set of proposed reforms aimed at restoring the Imperial State Legions to their former glory. Commonly dubbed the 'Doriosian Reforms', they include changes to recruitment standards, army logistics and most importantly improvements to inter-legion communication and anti-corruption measures. Whilst largely forgotten about in the wake of his death, we can adopt these proposals for our own benefit."
 
 innovation_imperial_religious_reformation:0 "Imperial Religious Reformation"
 innovation_imperial_religious_reformation_desc:0 "The Shattering of the Aautokrata and the sudden and violent death of much of our magically gifted ruling class during the Frodbrokna leaves us at an impasse. In their absence heresies and cults spring up around jumped up warlords and barbarian invaders, and they multiply by the day. Try as we might we cannot turn back the clock. That we are chosen by the Purest will never be in doubt, but how we act and worship must evolve to survive in this new age."
 
 innovation_marcher_adventurers:0 "Marcher Adventurers"
 innovation_marcher_adventurers_desc:0 "Chevalie is a land of war. It may not look it at first glance, with the true horrors of the north shielded from the faint of heart by the Bastione Mountains, but this is the truth of the matter no matter how verdant its fields and hospitable its people. Take a ride through any Marcher village and you'll quickly to spot a Waypriest of Swords running sparring exercises with a small squadron of adolescents. Turn West to Gisreddeport and you'll see the young graduates of those Waypriests eagerly chattering among themselves, boarding vessels bearing a riot of flags and pennants setting sail to explore the world under the banners of a thousand different sellsword companies. Though her borders may not be expanding, Chevalie's adventurous children have won enough victories to conquer every nation in the known world twice over."
