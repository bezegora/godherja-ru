Though there were others at fault as well, to be sure, almost all of this has fundamentally stemmed from one man, a person who we now have at our mercy.\n\nAfter cutting down the last of his pet fanatics, [prisoner_a.GetFirstName] now languishes in our deepest dungeon, awaiting his fate. To say that there's little remorse in the old [magi|E]'s rantings and ravings would be an understatement - he seems to be positively gloating in his reputation as the fool that left the world a burning ruin.\n\nNo matter. On this day, the whims of this petty, malicious, vile tyrant will finally cease to matter, once and for all."
