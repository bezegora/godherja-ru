While he fights the Gallicader insurgency and attempts to build a nation out of a tribe, Kathanouxa licks his wounds and prepares for revenge. There are whispers however, of rebellion, the Sheticans inspired to finally overthrow their dread master...\n\nFar across the seas to the south, the ancient religions of the east finally buckle under the weight as the warlord Nasad-Sinar who forced the land together lies dead and the Balarids struggle with the invasion of the western Ritualists."

While the Seychescian's had defeated the Aelarvisians twice before with aid from their eastern allies in the Mountain-Sun Temple, the brutal civil war between the ruling monastic orders and the secular warlords under Odyr Then means that the Seychescians stand alone.\n\nTo their north, the death of the nearly 200 year old Kathanouxa purpotedly at the hands of the aging Bastione himself has thrown the Kingdom of Deccecads into chaos as the Twelve Magi-Regents each fight over the remains."

Vercigex, his brother in all but blood, sits on his throne as a regent until the situation is decided. It was Bastione's last wish for Vercigex to rule, but Vercigex's magical ability is viewed with suspicion. Not only was Kathanouxa, their dreaded enemy, a magi, so were the Seychescians who once held them in chains. Not only that, but Vercigex's mind is increasingly wracked with visions, of a crack in the world through a mountain skull, of the fallen dead rising again across blackened ground, of a new era of slavery for the known world and for an apocalyptic war across endless beaches.\n\nAs the Gallicads retreat west to their last strongholds in an attempt to overthrow the viceroy Inian, and powerful Shewigad lords sharpen swords while looking upon Bastione's throne with envy, the question seems to be when it will all fall apart."

While his plans of an Imperial cult seem to be failing as the people scoff at such an impious ruler forming a faith, raids into the interior of the new Aelarvisian colonies by the Iyrossi tribes have left hundreds dead. As the people of the Aelarvisia demand retribution, Phanagorax erects a great column in Oraespole and gathers the largest Legion ever seen by his peoples, and declares that he will not rest until the Iyrossi have fallen before their might.\n\nIn the south, the last remnant of the Balarids, long converted by their enemies to the 1,000 God faith of the Eos, begins an exodus south as the final eastern strongholds fall to the Ritualists.

Whoever slays the great beast shall be King.\n\nThe scramble begins.\n\nWith what is slowly being called Chevalie by the slowly formalizing Shewigad cultures in pieces after the murder of Vercigex, warlords squabble for petty means. Several have already begun crossing the mountains east and wiping out the fallen remains of the Ethylisiads, while others have begun to press north against the Oejeynica in a desire to build their own empires."

The deep running cliques between Aversaria's dragon riders have each chosen a side, and hundreds of dragon riders now pillage the countryside and do battle over decades of grudges, finally with the excuse to unleash their power.\n\nIn the north, Oejeynica sits on the knife's edge. The Enlightency of Vrawsyl lays silent, panicked refugees fleeing from its borders in droves, claiming that the honored dead have risen against them, while Vilas Venslau declares himself the first Archlich, and demands fealty of the world... already, the Oejeynica kings prepare their armies against this new unknown threat, even as they do war with the invaders from the south."

Contrary to what many hoped however, the liches haven't been destroyed in one epic final battle, instead his acolytes have all rushed north to secure the pieces of their former master's domain, carving their own fiefdoms out of the remains of Oejeynica. Thousands pour south as the land they once tended to dies, and the Marchers—still struggling to recover their home and deal with the refugees both.\n\nIn the far west, the Prophet has given his voice to the Amsari wastes, claiming that he has seen the future of their people's. A great struggle against the Ran Kamsari in the south, one that they will eventually win. As the new religion spreads like wildfire, the death of King Alqad in the east sends ripples across the Ritualist world, as the grandson of they who slew the Worldeater passes, dozens of warlords have already begun fighting for the right to claim their title."

Possibly inspired by the Prophet of the Amsari, thousands of cult religions have rapidly taken hold and new ones seem to pop up by the day.

Wishing to resettle the Oejeynicain his borders and unite the Marchers against a new foe with [arch_lich|E] Wisleyx destroyed, he pushes the Marcher frontiers east.

God is real, and he is evil, and the sins of the decadent Ritualists are slowly breaking the lock which binds him. Already this mysterious new cult has spread across the southern world, and as the great powers of Khmet and Darajad skirmish among their borders, the Wardenites seem poised to throw off the balance of power forever.\n\nMeanwhile in the north, Dellinos stands victorious over his brothers after a decade of civil war, finally beginning his grand plan to unite the cultures, languages and religions of what he now calls Aversaria, all the while sending his legions to expunge the northern [antimagi|E] from their forts along the great river valleys of Kalathipsomi. But even as he works, a new force stirs. Arthenanas, brother of Maklea, has finally passed while in hiding. His grandson Theryion, the Last Dragon, intends for only one thing.

The north lies open, Aautokratir Pathos need only reach out and take it...\n\nIn Sarradon the borders have been drawn and war truly begun.

Spreading out of Asiupoli, the Aversarians and several allies among the eastern clans have begun systematically destroying realm after realm, intent on spreading Aversaria to the mysterious eastern steppe."

In the Chevalien colonies to the east, the lack of authority has inspired a wave of rebellion, and the Ducal League struggles to hold the frontier of the Marcher world.\n\nIn Aversaria, Aeliadias is victorious in both the civil war and her battle against Arthenax.

Not only has the longrunning struggle between the governors of Kalathipsomi and Malcois finally broken to civil war with the death of Aeliadias, but Count Themos has set the east aflame with his conversion to lichdom. With the risen legions of Aironoi and Opakhasia before him, and a child Aautokratir on the throne, many claim that this is the final conflict to end the world. Especially as reality itself bends and snaps, a Gedoera ripping across the Empire and destroying the very fabric binding reality, Imperial cities seemingly move back and forward in time at their own will."

While Kalathipsomi and Malcois finally find peace, and the Liches Themos and Adwaga are both dead, plague now tears through the battered remains of Aversaria and into the Marches both. With the first High King in a generation cut down by the Bloodblight only months after his coronation, the Chevaliens finally abandon their holdings in the east and cross the Black Mountains to try and salvage what little remains of their fracturing homes.\n\nIn Aversaria, the Bloodblight burns through not only the peasantry but seems even more dangerous to the realm's Magi, killing an entire generation of the magical nobility before spreading south to Sarradon where it spreads equal discord, causing a temporary pause to the many wars. To Aversaria's northeast, the Imperium of the Kartharadds looks south at their ailing rival with greed in their eyes, and prepares for a great invasion of Malcois."

Reforged and reformed by Aautokratir Eramos and his cabal of Legons, the new model Aversarian army marches to reclaim the northern heartland from the overstretched Kartharadds.\n\nIn Sarradon, the destruction of the magic class by the Bloodblight has led to a revolution in its practice. This new generation of magi, without the teachings of the old, have increasingly turned to the use of previously forbidden magics thought to be too dangerous to be taught. As the continent burns in magical fury, the expanding Amsari are finally brought to a stop by the Wardenites, who push them back into their heartlands and secure the west, the last time the Amsari will ever dare expanding their borders brought to an end by horrible magics."

Two dozen claim to hold the blood of the Prophet and begin bloody war using new magical arts taught by their eastern foes. As the Amsari homeland burns however, a new force arrives from the east. Displaced from their home as the eastern plains are torched to dust by Wardenite and Ritualist magi, the Ayyar peoples overwhelm the local Wardenite lords and begin pushing the Amsari border north.\n\nTo their south, the great warlord Henutaht has united much of the Ran Kamsari heartlands and plots revenge. With Sarradon's religious revolution reaching even his ears, he prepares his great armies and his magi for a final devestating war in the north, with the plan to finally take revenge on the Amsari, and ensure not a single Amsari lives to ever do war upon his people again."

With Etepezea, Malcois and Kalathipsomi especially devestated, and with massive but undeveloped royal holdings in the east still held from the defeat of Themos, a radical new reconstruction plan focuses on shifting the powerbase of the Empire to the rapidly growing city of Asiupoli and the rich mountains of Opakhasia.\n\nIn the Marches, High Queen Arelli begins driving the Oejeynica from their ghettoes in Chevalie's cities and grants them new land in the depopulated north, hoping to end the pogroms and conflict between them in the natives.

A self replicating spell that wiped clean entire regions, none who casted it with the blood of thousands expected for it to spread uncontrolled across Sarradon, and by the time it and the massive magical conflicts around it finally end, 80% of Sarradon's magi and millions otherwise lay dead.\n\nWith Sarradon in ruins and the wars temporarily quieted in the devestation, more and more foreigners begin entering the ports of the once gilded cities with new interest. With the Sarradonian lords so ruined, Aversarian and Chevalien merchants both begin growing their presence, sectioning off great trade quarters and slowly taking over the southern trade routes."

Nowhere is this more welcomed than Sarradon, where a generation of Sarradonian nobility have taken great interest in leveling the playing field with the scattered remains of their magi, and where the slowly recovering continent desperately seeks any trade opportunity."

Increasingly paranoid and clearly insane, he even kills his remaining children, accusing them of assisting in their brother's murder.\n\nThamean, after four years of civil war and thousands dead, is now dead himself, slitting his wrists in his throneroom in a maddened display.

While the five pretender Kings of the Marches either lay dead or surrender their claims, however, many look towards potential reunification, seeing the War as proof that Chevalie must stand strong.\n\nIn Sarradon, Abdar 'Godrender' Sarhadyn begins an ambitious campaign to destroy the Ritualist hold on the far east.

As Chevalie collapses into its first great religious war, the upcoming Council of Ex will decide what exactly shall be done.

As even those who benefit from the blood of the slaves now questions the truth in their beliefs, eight figures have risen up across Aversaria to demand a new age of reform.
