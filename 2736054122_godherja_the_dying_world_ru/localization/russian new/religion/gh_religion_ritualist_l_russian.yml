 ritualist_religion_desc:0 "Less of a defined faith and more a label for a collection of local beliefs, Ritualism is a polytheistic group of faiths native to [sarradon|E] that tend to have esoteric beliefs and secretive ceremonies. Common among these sects is their reverence for the Thousand-and-One Steps of Sophocos, a [tower|E] where one can achieve enlightenment if they climb every man-sized step and face a plethora of trials from the gods. The few who achieved this task had their accounts compiled in the Story of the Steps, an esoteric tome which is consulted for guidance and whose meanings are hotly debated among its followers. To walk the Thousand-and-One steps is not only a literal pilgrimage for Ritualists, but also a figurative quest for self-improvement."

This crater, they insist, is the doorway to the afterlife, and those who are worthy enough to reach the bottom may enter into the realm of the gods."

Then came Hound, guardian of the dead and warriors. Hound was enraged at Lion, for Lion had no care for the lives of the humans he had created, and no loyalty to his creation. Before there could be a great war between the two, Lynx tricked Lion into inviting Hound into his home. As the entire Earth was Lion’s home, he was bound by the rules of hospitality, and thus Lion and Hound were bound together as brothers."
