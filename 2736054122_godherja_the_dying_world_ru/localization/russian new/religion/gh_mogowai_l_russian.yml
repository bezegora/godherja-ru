 mogowai_religion_desc:0 "The Mogowai believe that their god, known only as the Most High, once had a physical avatar who walked upon the earth and interacted with supplicants. However, He was attacked by an army of nonbelievers, who burnt His temples, destroyed His offerings, and even slew Him. His body was spirited away to places unknown, and it is the duty of the Mogowai ('Searchers' in their language) to track down this body and give it proper last rites, after which the Most High shall be born in a new body and peace shall return to the world."

 mogowai_desc:0 "The Mogowai take their task of finding the body of the Most High incredibly seriously. While a good many just pray that He leads His followers to His final resting place, others are compelled to go out into the world and search themselves. They retread old paths thought to be dead ends, or search in completely undiscovered locales, and pursue any lead about a sacred burial site in hopes of fulfilling their one goal."
