 fogeater_religion_desc:0 "While nobody has ever managed to communicate with the [fogeaters|E], one of the only things verifiably known is that they name themselves the 'Listeners'.\n\nThe result of tribal humans being trapped in the [foglands|E], unlike all other beings who had been destroyed by the Foglands millions of dangers, the [fogeaters|E] instead adapted. Or, as one would think when looking upon their malnourished, nearly alien forms, corrupted.\n\nThe [fogeaters|E] worship the [fog|E] now, and devour or corrupt any they capture in disturbing esoteric rituals meant to assist them in speaking with their esoteric masters."
