 hubarism_religion_desc:0 "The Hubarists are part of an ancient faith in [sarradon|E], one practiced by Living Mages as far back as recorded history goes. At the center of the faith is the Sun, the origin of all things and whose blessings come down upon mages as rays of light shine upon the crops. As the Sun travels across the sky, it ferries the souls of the dead to its realm, where it holds court during the night. The Sun's antagonist is Ölüm, who sends his avatar the Moon to hunt the Sun during the night."

 hubarism_desc:0 "The Hubarists treat magi, who received their gifts from the Sun, as keepers of its will and enforcers of the law. This system of mage-judges was effective since time immemorial, but its fortunes have reversed recently. Centuries of religious conflict with the [wardenites|E], [ritualists|E], and finally the Agonists have greatly diminished their power, and the Hubarists are now a shadow of what they once were."
