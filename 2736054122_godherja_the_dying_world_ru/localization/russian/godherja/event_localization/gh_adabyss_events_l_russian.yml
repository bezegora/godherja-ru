adabyss_event.0001.desc:0 "The wait from when the rider leaves to when [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] expect their return is a tense one indeed. The days of silence that follow that are tenser still. Rare is the Lëlmand that gains such a prestigious promotion from conquering lands so worthless. Rarer still is the Lëlmand that gains such a promotion without knowing the state of the lands beyond, especially while [GetPlayer.GetHerHis] superiors are so busy prosecuting far more important wars to the South and East… \n\n My doubts are settled when [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] am at last awoken by great horns on the fifth day. From my bedroom windows [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] spy them, gold and terrible, upon the horizon: \n\n The Mósëku Limpegail.\n\n They filter down from the gap between sky and land and into this dim realm like shimmering stars, a great column interspersed with many a Golden Statue. They shine so bright [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] think that for a moment they must have been sent straight from Wolmbaz-nza herself! The Limpegail might be one of the lesser scions of our great Adabyssian military but to myself and my peasantry both, they look as grand as any such force in all the world. \n\n Their presence here can mean only one thing..."

At [GetTopLiege.GetHerHis] back marches the Mósëku Limpegail, armour shimmering in the sands. Already [GetTopLiege.GetSheHe] has announced their pious intentions, in accordance with the Adabyssian faith: \n\n Go Forth And Conquer, so that all the world might join us in supplication."

adabyss_event.0003.desc:0 "For the past few weeks a strange tale has begun to filter out of the lands of Southern Damota, tales of golden warriors the size of two men, and the general at their head. Now, we finally have the truth of it: a stranger from the far south going by the title of Lëlmand has come into possession of a host far larger than his neighbours, or anything they could hope to contest. \n\n Already, they have announced intentions to conquer further lands. And with such a host at the Lëlmand’s back, can anyone possibly hope to stand in their way?"

As a pious follower of those selfsame creeds, it is your duty to conquer in the name of your faith, and to spread the holy teachings far and wide to any who yet breathe, whether or not they listen willingly. \n\nThat is why you have travelled northwards to this strange land, far from the borders of your home. Whether or not there is any glory to be found in such a backwater, especially with the Empire far more occupied with far more lucrative engagements, you must for yourself ascertain. It is well-known after-all that for every ambitious officer there is a Limpegail - a legion - awaiting that leader’s promotion, and their new orders..."
