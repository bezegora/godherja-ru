 aervalr.0101.desc.capital_county:0 "It would seem that a small fragment of Aervalr has graced the skies near our lands. We watch the teal fireball streak across the night sky as it begins to break up into an even more brilliant shower of shooting stars.\n\nThe arrival and disintegration of this celestial visitor has likely left a large amount of valuable, magically potent moonstone across the surrounding area."
 aervalr.0101.a:0 "Beautiful."
 aervalr.0102.t:0 "The Falling Sky"
 aervalr.0102.desc.capital_county:0 "A brilliant light in the night sky and rising rumble stop everyone in their normal evening duties. The sight outside is truly one to behold - a fairly large chunk of Aervalr is making landfall, and it shines and burns with the ferocity of a thousand flames as it reaches the ground.\n\nIn the morning, guards sent out to the presumed impact zone report little extensive damage apart from a few collapsed peasant hovels. The shard is still in one piece, and could prove quite useful to practitioners of magic."
 aervalr.0102.a:0 "Excellent."
 aervalr.0103.t:0 "The Falling Sky"
 aervalr.0103.desc.capital_county:0 "The jovial sounds of our evening feast are rapidly drowned out by a rapidly rising rumble from the outside. A blinding teal flash leaves everyone dazed, and soon afterward an explosion violently rocks the castle and leaves me completely unable to hear anything but ringing for several minutes.\n\nA large shard of Aervalr has struck our lands, apparently completely levelling a nearby village. Though the damage is extensive, the valuable magical ores it has left behind could prove a very useful boon."
 aervalr.0103.a:0 "It could have been worse.."
 aervalr.0104.t:0 "The Falling Sky"
 aervalr.0104.desc.capital_county:0 "The fire crackles, the few servants still awake make muffled chatter in the hallways, and I am slowly drifting into sleep. But then, I hear it - a low rumble, growing in intensity, coming from outside. Those in front of my room seem to hear it, too, as their talk dies down.\n\nLooking out the window, I only have a brief few moments to contemplate what I am seeing - a huge fragment of Aervalr, rushing towards the ground, before it crashes and sends out a shockwave that uproots trees, rends the ground and shakes the foundations of my hold into nearly collapsing."
 aervalr.0104.a:0 "Duck!"
 aervalr.0105.t:0 "The Falling Sky"
 aervalr.0105.desc.capital_county:0 "I am roused from my sleep by the sounds of panicked screams. As I leave my bedchamber, courtiers and servants in their night gowns frantically run to and fro, seemingly oblivious to me and my inquiries as to what is going on. I notice that they are clustering on a balcony, looking at something in the sky.\n\nGazing up, it is immediately apparent that something strange is afoot. A large, dark shape overhead seems to have blotted out a portion of the starry sky.\n\nI nearly faint when I realize what it is."
 aervalr.0105.a.capital_county:0 "Holy mother of -"

 aervalr.0110.t:0 "The Falling Sky"
 aervalr.0110.desc:0 "Me, my family and court all stand awake in the wee hours of the night, huddled near our windows. Outside, a sight to truly behold - a fragment of Aervalr of epic propotions is making way towards the ground, ready to make contact at any moment. Thankfully, it is far away enough as to not present any danger at all - at least to us."
 aervalr.0110.a:0 "Beautiful, but deadly."
