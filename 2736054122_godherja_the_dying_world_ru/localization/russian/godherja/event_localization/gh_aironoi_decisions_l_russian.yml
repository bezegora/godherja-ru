 investigate_valerix_decision_desc:0 "When Valerix first gathered his forces for the long march west, he told his assorted legion, "We march not for glory and gain, but for mothers and sons, fathers and daughters. We come home not for glory and not to parade, but for what is right and just. Only we can save our home, now and forever."\n\nEven now that he is dead, his words hang heavy on our souls. It is our duty to make wrongs right, and save our homeland, but before we do that we must avenge the father to us all. How can we save [aversaria|E] if we can not even right this smallest of wrongs?\n\nTo this end [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] need funds, with which [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] will gather a taskforce to track down the killer. Let none be safe from the rage of the legion, and let what happens next be a message to all of Aversaria."

 free_the_slaves_decision_desc:0 "The governor is dead, and Aironoi as we knew it disbanded. With Valerix avenged, a new age dawns, an age where we will fix [aversaria|E] and right wrongs a thousand years in the making.\n\nThe first step will be possibly our most controversial. The slaves of [aversaria|E] will no longer live in bondage, but as men. By breaking their chains we will give them the offer, they may leave or they may join us, and bolster our army further. While the hardliners will no doubt find issue, with the governor dead they have nobody to organize under, and with the numbers our new bretheren can bring in, we will be more prepared than ever to take back Asiupoli and then face the Witch-Breaker."
 free_the_slaves_decision_confirm:0 "Today, we are all [aversarian|E]s."
 aironoi_free_slaves_effect_tt:0 "Freeing the slaves will earn the enmity of our countrymen but the loyalty of many more. An army of those who swear loyalty will be gathered immediately. We will also be able to free slaves for various boons in future areas of conquest."
