While my family may have their own feelings on the matter, the sacred choice is ultimately mine. \n\nAnoited in the oils and having said the first half of the sacred oaths, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] must now only approach the father of my choosing and say the final words..."
marcher_lifepath.0001.a:0 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] approach the Wayfather of Swords"

marcher_lifepath.0001.d:0 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] approach the Wayfather of Harvests"
marcher_lifepath.0001.d.tt:0 "The Way of Harvests is the Path of simple prosperity and sustenance. While nearly every commoner follows it, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] can already feel the glares from my family as [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] even dare look at the Wayfather..."
marcher_lifepath.0001.f:0 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] approach the Wayfather of Crowns"

marcher_lifepath.0002.a.tt:0 "The Way of Justice is perhaps the rarest Path of all. The Path of those who seek to right wrongs and fight injustice, it is said to have been the way of Sir Ranos, who freed the Chevalien people from slavery. While highly respected, it is also almost unheard of for a ruler to actually follow it. The Wayfather of Justice himself leans against the altar as if he was bored of the occasion, and does not even bother to look me in the eyes... how mysterious."

marcher_lifepath.0002.c:0 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] approach the Wayfather of Crows"
marcher_lifepath.0002.c.tt:0 "The Way of Crows is the Path of secrets, both keeping and learning them.

marcher_lifepath.0002.d:0 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] approach the Wayfather of Nullification"
marcher_lifepath.0002.d.tt:0 "The Way of Nullification is the Path of the [antimagic_orders|E]. Rare outside of their venerated chapters, most do not follow it for its extremely specific focus, though it is an honorable one nonetheless."
marcher_lifepath.0002.e:0 "[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] look to the other four fathers"
marcher_lifepath.0002.e.tt:0 "Perhaps the Paths of Swords, Families, Coins, Crowns or Harvests would appeal to me more..."
