Awoken before sunrise, we Champions four break our fast with the Silken One, and all their attendant shamans. They explain that it is their duty to lead us to the site of the Final Ring. When at last we are led to the central monument -- the great banner tower of the Dovatkning -- there is more than little confusion. But the shamans are unpeturbed, and their master casts their voice voice skyward.\n\n"We Sjalvolki are ourselves stewards of the Middle Realm, and as we gather here today to determine our rightful [SCOPE.sC('previous_holder').GetPrimaryTitle.GetName], it is this responsibility we must remember. But rest assured, Champions of the Four Rings, you who deem yourself worthy of the realm, you stand with legions of glorious dead at your backs. And soon, you shall stand atop their shoulders too."\n\nWith a nod to their closest attendant, the Silken One brings forth a red-clad shaman, holding a great-axe high. With a quick command from his master, that shaman begins to take the axe to the monument, heavy swings thudding into the wood.\n\nThe speaker continues.\n\n"In felling our tower to tradition, we declare the story of [SCOPE.sC('previous_holder').GetFullName] at an end. It shall be for one of you four champions to determine what will come next."\n\nWhen at last the great tower is brought low, collapsing with relative safety, we champions are directed to crest the trunk. We do. [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] grip my weapon tight, and eye my opponents. One works to keep their balance; another is clearly taken aback by the occasion..."
