 world_story.0001.t:0 "The Fall of Oraispol"
 world_story.0001.desc:0 "A ragtag group of petty nobles from the northern capital has arrived in our lands, seeking refuge and bringing grave tidings - [title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier] has fallen to the barbarian hordes of [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName]! Despite a heroic defense by the hopelessly outnumbered garrison of the city, the once proud metropolis has been laid low and left a thoroughly ransacked, burned out husk of its former self. \n\nThe development, though silently anticipated ever since the disaster at the Elysian Pass, has still sent shockwaves across the already demoralized and war-torn remnants of the Empire. With the north now seemingly permanently slipping away into a barbarian-ruled anarchy, the prospects of a general restoration of imperial order grow ever more dim and unlikely."
 world_story.0001.desc.sjalvoki:0 "Today is a great day, for an old evil has finally met its end. The brave, unstoppable warriors of our people have driven a stake through the dark, bile-filled heart of the [aversarian|E] beast that once sought to devour all - [title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier] has fallen.\n\nAs [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName] gazes down upon the vanquished city, a new age dawns. With a clear victory over the Empire now widely considered a foregone conclusion, our great march across the known world is coming to an end. For all the glory earned and rich lands taken, it is finally time to call this place our new home."
 world_story.0001.desc.iyrossi:0 "Though the wheels of justice might turn slow, they do seem to turn indeed. After a thousand years of depravity, cruelty and boundless malice, the time has come for our former masters to repay their dues.\n\n[title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier], once a city thought invulnerable, now lies broken beneath the boots of [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName]. The arrogant edifices that once stood as a monument to the [aversarian|E]s' blind hubris are now nothing more than burning piles of rubble.\n\nThe long years of our captivity are finally coming to an end. We must seize the moment and throw off the last vestiges of the foreigner's yoke now, for a new, brighter future awaits our people."
 world_story.0001.desc.generic:0 "What initially seemed to be the exaggerated tavern gossip of passing mercenaries and merchants has now been confirmed by a herald from the court of [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName] - [title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier] has fallen.\n\nThough the great city had been undergoing a general decline with the ongoing disintegration of the Empire, the symbolic power of the event is still undeniable. All across the Shattered Coast, the news has been met with utterly predictable horror by [aversarian|E]s of all stripes, while their enemies have erupted into jubilant revelry. Though no doubt an event of enormous historical magnitude, however, we ultimately hold little stakes in that particular race."

 world_story.0100.desc:0 "This is it. This is the culmination of my life's work, my finest hour, the greatest joy I shall ever feel.\n\nI was born as no one. My place of birth was a village out in the most backwater of colonies, long since consumed by the [fog|E]. Battle by battle, corpse by corpse, I have clawed my way from the very edges of the world to its beating, gilded heart, and come to claim it for myself.\n\nAs I make my way towards the Column of the Purest, the euphoric crowds lining the streets shout my name, their jubilant screams almost a deafening cacophony.\n\n'Savior! Black Sun! Autokratir! Purest!'"
 world_story.0100.a:0 "There is still much to be done."
 world_story.0101.t:0 "Bastonport"
 world_story.0101.desc:0 "We are getting closer to our ultimate goal. Not even a few years ago, all I had was a single, weakened legion under my command, and a few worthless tracts of land in the extreme north of [aversaria|E].\n\nToday, I hold one of the Empire's most bountiful cities, and its surrounding countryside. The road here was not easy - for every meadow, every forest, every farmhouse, enough blood was spilled to feed a river. Kalithipsomi used to be a feral, barbarian-controlled anarchy, but now I have finally brought order to the troubled province. My deeds are great enough that, if I wish, I can rename the city in my honor, and it would not be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut Bastonport, rich as it is, is not what I desire. And I turn my eyes south, my life's desire tantalizingly close..."
