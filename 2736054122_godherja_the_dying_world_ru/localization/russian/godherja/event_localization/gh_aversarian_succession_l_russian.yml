As [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] am a Doux or higher, and our Purest just died, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] can choose to engage in this fight to the death or stay out."
 aversarian_succession.0001.desc.inelegible:0 "My predecessor has passed away, and the throne falls into my hands - or at least, that would be the conventional wisdom. However, as per our ancient [aversarian|E] traditions, only those with the finest of arcane skillsets are fit to don the crown, skillsets proven in vicious magical duels to the death.\n\nSadly, either due to a complete lack of magical capability, youth or other factors, I am unable to actually compete in the [blood_senate|E]. Until such a time as a proper successor is chosen, though, I am the custodian of the throne. If no other candidate presents themselves, it passes to me by default, though this is a long shot unless I use... other means to encourage them to drop out."
