Whether through kind words about how [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] am too compassionate or loving to my children, or through cruel ones about how [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')]’m an old fool unable to do what needs to be done.\n\nI know the dangers. [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] know that the Chevalien merchants [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] have welcomed are vultures, that my sons bare daggers meant for one another.

[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] want it all.”\n\n”And you shall have it all, mortal,” the figure sneered back, turning and stepping towards the fogged glass window. “The [towers|E].

[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] don’t know the answers to these questions, but [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] know one thing.

Village by village, grove by grove, meadow by meadow, we were gradually being reduced to refugees with no home, and the fault was not even our own. The [aversarian|E] menace, in their eternal greed and malice, have set the world aflame, and we were to pay the price of their transgressions first.\n\nBut it was not to be.\n\nUnder my banner, I have united the thousand clans, and for the first time in memory, we march as one. One people, one army, one cause - the claiming of our new birthright. Recently, we have finally shattered the last enemy host of any respectable size whatsoever at the Elysian Pass, and their homelands stand ripe for the taking. The crimes of a thousand years will meet justice, the wicked will be struck down, the arrogant - humbled, and my people given a new home."

Those ships I 'found' to take me here brought me well before the rest of my comrades in the Imperrech and lovely old Cenware, but with my countrymen marching close, the time of having nothing besides glorious battle on all sides may be coming to an end.\n\nBah!

Forgotten entirely?\n\nBut the books I surrounded myself with as a girl held knowledge, great knowledge I have used to survive the intricacies and intrigues of the heathen court. Perhaps, maybe, if I simply... think... then perhaps I can find us a new path. As the last chance for [sophocoism|E], is this any less than my holy duty?"

Who am I to resign them all to death, like so many others have? And with what my homeland has done, can I say that this is not divine retribution we now face?\n\nMy countrymen call me a coward, a compassionate fool. Well pity to them. As the Governor of Opakhasia it is my duty to save my people, and if I must crawl to the Witch-Breaker and beg for it, then I shall."
