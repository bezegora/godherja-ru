apokiakas_desc:0 "#size:15    Apokiakas, or 'Colonials' in the [aversarians|E] language, is the term given to any [aversarians|E] hailing from the northeastern colonies of Katraddia. While Katraddia was considered equal in standing to the other governances ever since the 932 IS Trelytion Dispute, it was nevertheless looked down on as a series of colonies instead of a proper province, and generally remained the most loosely held and rugged frontier of Aversaria until its destruction by the opening of [the_rift|E] and its transformation into the [foglands|E]. Descended from colonists sent primarily from Kalathipsomi due to their experience with rugged northern terrain, the Apokiakas adopted many of their qualities, preferring more mundane and practical things to decadent displays. They often went even further, northerners becoming known for mixing [aversarians|E] garb with tribal wear, worshipping a mix of [aversarian|E] and native gods, and even marrying into tribal dynasties in order to secure alliances and their borders.\n\nA hardy and proud people, they were nonetheless nearly entirely destroyed in [frodbrokna|E] and the [fog|E], what few survivors there were interspersing as refugees in the south, swearing fealty to Cenware 'Witch-Breaker' and the Sjalvolki or being led west by Nicanoneus, the Black Sun.#"
northernimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Northern [aversarians|E] are the remnants of [aversarians|E] born north of Etepezea and west of Malcois, in the rugged colonies of Kalathipsomi. While Kalathipsomi was considered equal in stance to Etepezea, Opakhasia, Aironoi and even above Katraddia, it was nevertheless considered a rather barbaric and unsophisticated version of the [aversarian|E] culture by its contemporaries.\n\nTaking many qualities from the native cultures they ruled over, the Kalathipsomians were known for preferring more practical and less extravagant clothing and architecture than their southern comrades, though northern woodwork from the Living Trees of the massive forests in the region is exceptionally valued for its quality and beauty.\n\nDespite this, Northern Imperials are known as shrewd traders and excellent taskmasters, having run the massive lumberyards, mines, and the farms that make up Aversaria's breadbasket ever since the [marcher_aversarian_wars|E]. The traditional colors associated with northerners are greens, blacks, greys and reds.#"
easternimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Eastern [aversarians|E] are [aversarians|E] born in the [aversarians|E] cities of Aironoi. Technically the smallest of the [aversarians|E] cultures due to the majority of Aironoi being ruled by steppe clans and other peoples, they nevertheless have represented the most wealthy and powerful of the [aversarians|E] people's since Aironoi's rise after the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E].\n\nExorbitantly wealthy thanks to Asiupoli's rise as the trade hub of Aversaria and the world, as well as the city's appointment as the capital of the Aautokrata, Eastern [aversarians|E] are known for their exceptionally decadent showings of wealth. By the 10th century, most fashion in Aversaria was dictated by non-Eastern nobility playing catchup with the rapidly changing and often gaudy court dress of the east, and the nobility of Aironoi are known for regularly causing theological and cultural shocks through their displays designed to shock and make themselves the talk of Aversaria. Eastern [aversarians|E] are traditionally associated with the colors pink, purple, teal, gold and white.#"
southernimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Southern [aversarians|E] are those [aversarians|E] native to the former cosmopolitan center of Opakhasia. While once very wealthy due to the riches of their homeland and its control over trade, the rise of Aironoi and the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E] devastated the province; causing depopulation, famine and war, as well as the loss of southern trade. Despite this, the nobility are still known for excessive displays of wealth, Starving slaves and livestock tending near-barren fields not uncommon while traveling to one of the many feasts in gold gilded halls of the nobility.\n\nAs the government of Opakhasia is descended from the ancient 'Mountain-Sun Temple', so are the trappings of Southern [aversarians|E] culture. Southerners hold religious titles that would have been common a thousand years prior, and are known for displays of piety despite their decadence. The colors of Opakhasia are whites, golds and oranges, based off the colors of the ancient Mountain-Sun.#"
westernimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Western [aversarians|E] represent the [aversarians|E] native to Etepezea. Considered the progenitors of [aversarian|E] culture, Western Imperials are considered exceptionally proud of their heritage and sure to make their strong bloodlines known through regular displays of power. They are a rather drab and dour people, but highly regarded as the most 'regal' and 'imperious'.\n\nDespite their wealth, they are not considered as decadent as other [aversarian|E] cultures, preferring to let their riches be known through their reputation than through elaborate displays of their riches. Traditionally associated with the colors red, black and gold, Western [aversarians|E] are largely known for their skilled politicking, strong rule, powerful magics and for the heavy infantry that would eventually build the [aversarian|E] Legions. Many [aversarian|E] scholars consider Western [imperial|E] culture to be a creole of the innumerable city-states that would eventually be united into the Aautokrata, and as the modern progenitor for all other Imperial cultures.#"
centralimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    [aversarians|E] from the region of Malcois are referred to as Central [aversarians|E]. Regarded as a rich people, they are not considered particularly proud or modern, preferring conservative politics and dress as compared to many other [aversarians|E]. Known for managing the massive slave-estates and factories of Malcois, they wear simple clothes and armor of unpainted iron, and live in homesteads that double as forts in case of slave uprisings. Central [aversarians|E] are considered an honest people, generally shunning intrigue and subterfuge as slave tactics and preferring their dealings me upfront and honest in nature.\n\nRarely known for any sort of show of wealth and power, they are still feared for their iron gripped rule, and nobles regularly carry chains of iron worn about their waist or over their shoulder, or decorating their armor, as a quiet sign to their enemies.

erimatos_desc:0 "#size:15    The Erimatos descend from the original [aversarian|E] colonists that arrived in [sarradon|E] with the Saradoani Apokiakas Archian in the aftermath of the continent's devastation by [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] in the 10th century. With the entire wider region reduced to ashes, they were able to rapidly secure favorable deals with the desperate locals and found thriving colonies across the coast.\n\nOwing to their far longer presence in the area, the Erimatos have assimilated numerous local customs and practices, markedly unlike the stubbornly zealous Agionists. Several centuries and an entire sea separating them from [aversaria|E] proper have resulted in a dialect nearly unintelligible by their continental brethren, and intermarriage with locals means that even their appearance is subtly distinct from the relatively recently arrived Makryenis.\n\nThe bloodletting of [the_saints_war|E] has seen them caught in the crossfire - the Agionists tend to give them a cold, distrustful shoulder due to religious differences, while the natives treat them with outright hostility due to their perceived ties to the Saintly Orders.#"
makryenis_desc:0 "#size:15    Makryenis refers to a melting pot of various [aversarian|E] cultures that would arrive in [sarradon|E] with the great wave of colonization that would follow the start of [the_saints_war|E] in the 1140s, united only by a near-fanatical devotion to the Agionist creed. In their early years, they were known for their great social mobility and respect of meritocracy, and countless wretched souls on the Continent would brave the journey south for a chance at a better life in [sarradon|E]. Despite their modern reputation, they were also once considered a breath of fresh air on the continent, and as genuine facilitators of peace and a neutral third party to local squabbles and feuds.\n\nNowadays, though still going through great effort to paint themselves as honorable and righteous, their decline into general cruelty and capriciousness has made them infamous across [sarradon|E], and the Makryenis are usually looked down upon as a group of brutal thugs at best, or as loathsome tyrants to be driven back into the sea at worst.#"
mondecny_desc:0 "#size:15    A largely peaceful and isolationist people, the Mondecny dwelt since time immemorial in the eastern portion of what is now known as the [foglands|E]. Though long sheltered from aggression by the mountains of the Krodgen range and the uniquely dense forests of their homeland, these natural defenses proved lacking with the arrival of the warlike [aversarians|E] who saw in the Mondecny a most invaluable resource - a population of slaves who were unlikely to revolt. Thus began the darkest era of their history.\n\nSo it was that when Cenware's coalition broke the back of [aversarian|E] resistance most Mondecny were brought into the Imperrech not from their traditional homelands, but from massive slave plantations located in the core of [aversaria|E]'s Katraddia governorship. Now freed after more than a generation of persecution and abuse, the Mondecny have settled in the dense Knokidbes forest in northern Malcois and many seem determined to resume their peaceful cultural traditions.#"
huegodocs_desc:0 "#size:15    A cosmopolitan culture hailing from the territories on the far side of the Black Gate, the Huegodocs dwelt in a number of prosperous towns and cities along the Great River, collecting lucrative tolls and farming the rich soil. When the [aversarians|E] arrived they were lucky and shrewd enough to negotiate a relatively favorable deal for peace: non-citizen subjects, but still free men and women.\n\nThey were well on their way to assimilation within [aversarian|E] culture, and had a few more generations passed may have become almost indistinguishable from their Apokiakas neighbors when the [frodbrokna|E] struck Aeras. When it became clear that any [aversarian|E] efforts to rescue the local population from the encroaching [fog|E] were inadequate to save their local allies, the Huegodoc chose to throw in their lot with Cenware's coalition.#"
sarminians_desc:0 "#size:15    The Sarminians are a matriarchal culture hailing from the far eastern edge of the lands now lost to the [fog|E], where the thick forests thinned into hills and steppes, and the vast empire of the Kathun-Kai is a more relevant threat than the distant [aversarians|E]. Their histories say that they were the western flank of a much larger nomadic federation, a rival and purported military equal to the Kathunians, but when the [frodbrokna|E] struck and the rest of their nation fled east, the Sarminians were unable to follow as the sea of [fog|E] cut off the route.\n\nForced to flee away from their kith and kin, they pushed deep into the west before encountering the Imperrech. Since joining forces with the Witch-breaker on the promise of new lands, the Sarminians have proven themselves fearsome warriors and as horsewomen skilled enough to rival the Kikarsags and Vanavids.#"
voyagen_desc:0 "#size:15    The Voyagen originate from the northwestern backwaters of Chevalie. In search of more prosperous lands, they began sailing, seizing both other regions within the Marches and colonies on distant shores. Over time, these adventures and conquests would allow these adventurers to begin exerting influence over the rest of Chevalie. Due to both their military tradition and overseas holdings, the High King has almost always been Voyagen. This, in turn, has led to their culture increasingly becoming the metropolitan one of the nobility, as the other cultures of Chevalie slowly drift towards it. It is normal to find Voyagens employed as explorers, soldiers or in other such pursuits, and they are the face of the Marches to the outside world. \n\nVoyagen tradition places a large emphasis on individual accomplishment, and cooperation between them can be difficult. Many will seek their own personal glory, even when the route is more perilous. This has led to both triumphs and defeats throughout Chevalien history, and is, in part, responsible for the various warlord eras, along with simple greed. Despite this, the Voyagen will gladly fight the [liches|E] when they come south, standing alongside the rest of the Marchers.#"
dawasid_desc:0 "#size:15    The Dawasid people that dwell in the far east of [sarradon|E] descend from the nomadic Mar'maladid tribes of the desert interior that settled among the numerous small-scale rivers of the Moranesh area. Despite their now largely sedentary lifestyle, they have not lost the warlike bent and ruthlessness of their roaming cousins to the west, and Dawasid culture is still very much one shaped by the harsh conditions of their land.\n\nIn particular, due to the extreme scarcity of any kind of natural resources of wealth, the Dawasids have taken up piracy and slave-raiding as an almost seasonal trade in and of itself, and their corsairs were once the most feared force of the east [sarradon|E]ian coast. In recent decades, however, they have been unable to compete with the organized, coordinated armadas of the Order of Saint Calysto's Key, and have themselves become one of the primary source of 'penitents' for the order.#"
utyalid_desc:0 "#size:15    The Utyalid are the almost entirely nomadic people of the harsh deserts of east [sarradon|E]. Hardy men and women only managing to eke out a meagre existence in the best of times, they are known as desert warriors without equal, their understanding of the surrounding sandy wastes unparalleled by any other culture.\n\nQuite naturally, this skill was honed by centuries of raiding their settled neighbors for plunder, and generally making themselves a perennial thorn in the side of whatever the current dominant power of the region was. Their incursions most frequently strike Kekhenemhat, but the Gonan road is also a fairly popular target, and some ambitious chieftains have even went so far south as the lands of the Mogowai.\n\nTraditionally [wardenite|E] to the bone, they once dominantly followed the Harfi'a creed, but conversion efforts over the centuries have reduced it to only the most backwards of tribes deep in the desert interior.#"
mutsartan_desc:0 "#size:15    The Mutsartan are the western branch of the Mar'maladid peoples, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle in the inhospitable Jayyal-el-Alfirk mountains. Though somewhat more settled than the Utyalid, they are considered to be none the more civilized, and some even consider them to be even more barbaric. Of course, this isn't helped in the slightest by the fact that, like seemingly all the other Mar'maladid cultures, they are all too happy to treat brigandry as a perfectly valid full-time occupation.\n\nWhat sets them apart from their brother cultures to the east, however, is their adherence to the strange religion known as 'Quwazaw' which they adopted in the indeterminate past. Attempts to trace the faith back to mainline [ritualism|E] or [wardenism|E] have all produced assertions based on shaky evidence at best, and scholars have remarked that the faith most closely resembles the Adabyssinians' worship of their golden statues, though how the Mutsartan could have picked up this tradition from them is unknown at present time.#"
adnanari_desc:0 "#size:15    The Adnanari are the people of the east [sarradonian|E] kingdoms of Kekhenemhat. Though widely thought to descend from Mar'maladid tribes who completely abandoned their nomadic lifestyles and settled down in the Khenem river valley and the nearby coasts over a thousand years ago, their modern connection with the other Mar'maladid cultures can only be noticed by the astute scholar. Their languages have diverged to the point of complete mutual unintelligibility, and their customs even more so.\n\nControlling the critical juncture at which the Gonan road meets the north [sarradonian|E] coast, they have developed a strong commercial spirit, and have managed to offset the relative infertility of the Khenem river valley with income and imports from their mercantile endeavors. On the other hand, they have not quite lost the warrior spirit of their nomadic brethren, as constant warfare with raiders from the desert interior meant that martial prowess was still a skill in great need. This would serve them quite well when the Agionists arrived in the 12th century, and although they would ultimately be brutally subjugated, they were consistently the most rebellious group of people nominally under the [aversarians|E]' boot - and the first to successfully break free of their yoke in the [faghira_jalil_revolt|E].#"
jaduyada_desc:0 "#size:15    The Jaduyada are the people of the eastern Kharadamat peninsula of [sarradon|E]. Residing in the immediate vicinity of the great [tower|E] of Sophocos, their culture was very likely the cradle in which early [ritualism|E] grew in the distant, forgotten past, and they were some of the most stalwart Sophocists during the entirety of [war_in_heaven|E]. Intensely sectarian in nature, they were only united under a single banner once in recorded history, preferring to instead be divided amongst as many clans as the mind can imagine.\n\nOn the upside, they are also some of the most free-thinking people in all of [sarradon|E], and are often lambasted as being borderline libertine by their more conservative neighbors. The intellectual diversity fostered in this environment has resulted in a wealth of artistic and scientific heritage that was the envy of the rest of the continent for centuries.\n\nTheir almost complete conquest by the Saintly Orders in the 12th century would soon be followed by repressions of massive proportions, and what little of their intelligentsia were left alive after the [judges_massacre|E] in 1207 would soon seek refuge in neighboring lands instead. The Jaduyadas' simmering rage has grown with each decade of Agionist mistreatment, and the culture has become markedly less tolerant of outsiders than it had been in the past.#"
hudi_desc:0 "#size:15    The Hudi of western Kharadamat are a people that have been defined by their faith for most of their history - even moreso than their neighbors. For millennia rejecting both [ritualism|E] and later [wardenism|E], they instead venerated Shub-Yuaguag - the Milk-Mother, despite attempts by preachers of both rival religions to convert them to their creed. Though increasingly adopting [wardenism|E] in the last few centuries, they are to this day known to be conservative to a fault. Abroad and in distant lands, they're far more well known for the quality of their artisanal goods - especially their weapons. It is said that a Hudi scimitar can cut through steel armor like a dagger through a piece of cloth, and they tend to fetch a similarly admirable price.\n\nWith the subjugation of the kingdom of Kudamash as a client state by the Agionists in 1161, they've found the rigid ways that define them to be increasingly at odds with their new [aversarian|E] masters. Fatefully joining the rebel cause in the [faghira_jalil_revolt|E], they would become the prime target of Sansianite furor in the [kahdavrakan_supper|E], and have since then largely fled their ancestral homelands for the relative safety of the Mamuramat. In crisis and without a home, mass conversions to [wardenism|E] have taken place, and it is likely that their ancient belief in the Milk-Mother is soon poised to disappear for good.#"
tasurmad_desc:0 "#size:15    The Tasurmad are the people of the Bay of Sihnamiyah, frequently regarded as a region of Aeras with one of the longest records of settled, urban civilization. Starting from the legendary Hundred Cities that dotted the land starting some four thousand years ago, the area would come to be the birthplace of no less than four major empires over the next two millennia. With the collapse of the Arakkariac Empire in the 4th century BI, the local denizens would gradually come under the increasing sway of [ritualism|E], which would bring them into the growing sphere of pan-[sarradonian|E] culture.\n\nOwing to the fertile soil and pleasant climate of their homeland, they are rarely forced to endure a bad harvest, and their nobility is used to the kind of extravagant displays that would find themselves at home in Opakhasia or Sereksi. However, this decadence should not be confused for softness, as the Tasurmad have been more than capable of holding their own in the countless cycles of wars of expansion and collapse in their long history.#"
amuaad_desc:0 "#size:15    Amuuad is perhaps best described as a cosmopolitan melting pot of virtually every major culture on the north coast of [sarradon|E]. Standing where the worlds of the [ritualist|E]-[wardenite|E] east meet exotic Khemet, Amsari and Ayyar, seemingly every facet of their language and customs has been loaned from one of their neighboring people.\n\nTheir language shares most in common with the Tasurmad, but their script is completely unlike most other surrounding cultures - rather than using Jaduyada letters, they instead use the glyphs of ancient Khemet, a legacy of the Ren Kemsari colonies founded in the region during their golden age. Their philosophy and religion incorporate a mix of [wardenite|E] legalism, Sophocist free-thinking and Amsari mysticism. Their artwork is built upon an eastern bedrock, but with significant Ayyar elements, their architecture - distinctly Khemetic. Finally, Amuuad garb and cuisine are such a riotous mixture of everything under the Sun that trying to piece together the origin of each element would be a futile task indeed.\n\nThe arrival of [aversarian|E] and Marcher adventurers from [the_continent|E] has been met with cautious curiosity, and the Amuuad seem keen to adopt yet more foreign ways to their ever-growing repertoire of assimilated traditions.#"
mirzana_jahar_desc:0 "#size:15    As the Ayyar were a landless, wandering people in [sarradon|E] for centuries, it is perhaps unsurprising that some of their more unscrupulous hosts had a tendency to attempt to subdue and enslave them. Though the occasional Ayyar slave could be found across the continent, they would gradually come to be concentrated in Khemet as slavery declined in popularity in the east. When the Battle of the Broken Chain shattered the Ren Kemsari for good, most of these Ayyar, known as the 'Mirzana Jahar', made their way east, where their Auzangeb brethren had recently established an independent state.\n\nThe Mirzana Jahar are arguably devoted to unity with their brother cultures even more than the Auzangeb. Their long ordeals as slaves has forged tight bonds among their community that persists to this day, and while they may be more than willing to overlook differences with their fellow Saradari, the same does not apply to outsiders. Ironically, though the Ren Kemsari persist as evil tyrants in their cultural memory even a thousand years after their destruction, it is undeniable even to a layperson that their artwork and customs have taken more than a few liberties in borrowing elements from their former masters.#"
babura_desc:0 "#size:15    The Babura are the people of the arid, hilly Babur valley in the interior of the Ayyar Empire. The Saradari group with the least amount of common historical identity, they are mainly the descendants of Saradari that have slowly trickled into the region long after the establishment of the Empire, as scattered, disorganized migrants rather than a unified group. As land in the fertile Dokkdur valley was becoming scarce, they were instead redirected to settle in the foothills of the Saddur mountains to the east.\n\nLargely cut off from the coast and the cosmopolitan heart of Sereksi, they would adopt simple, pastoral lifestyles. Though often seen as ignorant yeomen by their compatriots, they are well-regarded as the hardiest warriors the Empire can field, and more than one battle against foreign invaders has been won through their seemingly indestructible stubbornness. This has also come at a cost, though - the Babura are notoriously hostile to any attempts to disrupt their lifestyle, and have spearheaded more than one revolt against the capital after it meddled in their affairs for too long.#"
auzangeb_desc:0 "#size:15    The history of the Auzangeb is the story of Sereksi, the city that moves. Their tales still speak of the old, original metropole in their homeland, a city they claim was the greatest in all of Aeras. Yet today, nothing of their very oldest capital in the far east remains but a wistful memory, with some scholars even casting doubts on its existence. Since their arrival in [sarradon|E], the settlement bearing the name has been refounded thrice. The second Sereksi was on the miserable coasts of Ahradaban, and was destroyed by Mar'maladid aggression. The third, in the Bay of Sihnamiyah, and razed after choosing the wrong side in [war_in_heaven|E] one too many times. And of course, the fourth, final and current city, founded in the shadow of Khemet, which would grow to become the opulent capital of one of the premier empires of west [sarradon|E].\n\nThe journeys of Auzangeb saw them meet cultures beyond count, many of which have not survived to the present day. Along the way to their current homeland, they have adopted foreign customs, art, and even ways of thinking in almost every aspect of their culture, but yet still maintain a strong set of traditions from their distant eastern homeland, and have come to see themselves as the natural leaders of all the Ayyar cultures on the sandy continent.#"
jangkar_desc:0 "#size:15    The Jangkar are descended from the original Saradari diaspora in the eastern Bay of Khemet, having arrived in the area long before most of their other brethren. Merchants and mercenaries, they would form cordoned-off communities throughout the cities of the region, tolerated for their valuable services, but just as often finding themselves the scapegoats of whatever recent calamity befell the local populace. Though characterised by cliques and sub-cultures as countless as the cities of the region, they would slowly form a loose, common identity over the centuries and largely resist attempts at assimilation.\n\nWith the founding of the independent Ayyar state by the Auzangeb, they have gradually migrated away from the foreign cities that were so loath to accept their presence in the first place to the far more welcoming arms of their compatriots in Sereksi. Now largely settled along the eastern regions of the Empire, they mostly continue to live in communities determined by whatever foreign metropole they have originally arrived from. As such, it is difficult to pin down any universally shared cultural norms among them - perhaps a defining characteristic in and of itself.#"
Ran_Kemsarian_desc:0 "#size:15    Ran Kemsarian, the 'Heartland Kemsari', are the people of what was once the imperial nexus of Khemet. Though always somewhat distinct from the Almajun, the two cultures diverged most strongly during their separation in the Second Interregnum - at least, until the Battle of the Broken Chain. With the seemingly final destruction of the Kemsarian Empire and drastically reduced mobility between the two halves of the former realm, their differences have grown even more extreme.\n\nDuring their heyday, they were perhaps one of the most decadent, opulent and artistically inclined peoples of their age. More liberal, cosmopolitan and urban than their southern kin, their influence on surrounding cultures was the strongest of all the Kemsari. Likewise, they were the group that has historically tended to adopt the most foreign habits - though of course, this was a fact that they fervently denied. Today, however, they have fallen far from the heights they once soared, and are a warlike, tribal culture barely scraping by in the searing wasteland that was once their bejeweled empire.#"
Almajun_Kemsarian_desc:0 "#size:15    Though the north would come to be known as the heart of the Kemsarian Empire in its later years, it was southern Khmet where imperial power and culture were concentrated for the first thousand or so years of its existence.

Due to their position deeper in the desert, the Almajun were hit perhaps the hardest of all the Kemsarian groups, and their relative isolation from the rest of the world has bred an intensely warlike, xenophobic set of customs where foreigners are treated almost as mythological monsters and agents of evil rather than mere mortals. To say that they have almost completely abandoned the trappings of their once fine culture would be an understatement.#"
oejeynica_desc:0 "#size:15   The Oejeynica are the partially assimilated descendants of those who once inhabited the [lichdoms|E].

Rejected and scapegoated by their new neighbors, they were frequently victimized further with massacres and exile during the many [lich|E] invasions of the Marches. This would last until the reign of High Queen Arelli, who would drive them to the largely depopulated north where they would become a buffer against further [lich|E] incursions. Since then, they have earned the dubious honor of being the first to kneel at the coronation of each new High King, which is both a mark of prestige and submission. They have begun to assimilate to Chevalien culture, though still retain many distinctive traditions and customs. \n\nThe cultural practices of the Oejeynica are born of a fusion between Ojyczayn and Chevalien, from their unique dialect that blends the languages, to various everyday activities.

But [magi|E] were loathe to do hard work themselves, so the [aversarian|E]'s would bring in slaves to work their mines, till their fields, keep their houses clean and warm their beds. At the start the slaves were worked to death, brutalised, used in rituals by the practitioners, but they were far away from the readily available slaves the rest of the Empire had access to. As decadence soon took hold of the [magi|E], the chains on their slaves began to loosen. Over time the slaves were allowed more autonomy, able to have their own families (of course, born into servitude) and splitting cultures started to develop within the insular slaves. These cultures are what the modern [aversarian|E] would call a 'native.' Now the term Samojitian is the umbrella term for the 4 descendant slave cultures.#"

Glass houses were constructed, and the soil infused with magic in order for their crops to grow faster. \n\nThe proximity of these to the actual [magi|E] houses would be what would drive the Ukininkas and the Meistras together. Both shared between each other the symbols and words the Magi used and with some careless intermingling, the magic started to flow through their veins too.

Whenever something went wrong, they were the first to whom fingers were pointed, and they lived in cramped slums within Chevalien cities, all else having been taken from them. When they were resettled northwards, many began drifting towards Chevalien culture, leaving many of their roots behind. This did not apply to all, however.

It was this non-caring attitude that allowed the Meistras to be the first of the slave castes to begin to have [magi|E] blood running through their veins and the first to start learning the words of power. They were allowed to start families and could pass off a child as their husbands when in reality it was not. \n\nCenwares invasion allowed the Meistras to seize the initiative and attack from the inside, slaughtering men, woman and children before they fully could comprehend what was going on. Before Cenware, revolt had been all but a pipedream, but now freedom was a very real proposition.#"
mineris_desc:0 "#size:15   The most complacent of the slave castes, and with the shortest life span, the Mineris lived most of their life in the dark.

They constantly dig and create new rooms, tunnels, and mines for their [magi|E] masters. While normal realms would sell their mineral wealth and use it for weaponry or armour, the [magi|E] would rather use it to perform exotic transmutation rituals. It was not until they saw the smoke billowing and recovered from their shock, did they seize the north. Since fear was the driving factor behind keeping the Mineris in check and the [magi|E] mostly fled back to defend the Academy, the seizure of the North was almost bloodless.#"

While it was this that drove them to despise magic, it was the role the [magi|E] used them for that made them hate their masters. As the depths of magic were explored by [magi|E] it took a toll on both their mind and body. It would not take long for their partners to grow afraid and find themselves alone in bed. That is where the Skausmas come in, to play out any fantasies their master's demented minds dreamt up. \n\nAt first when Cenware attacked, the Skausmas were content to sit back and watch their world burn. It was not until fear of their masters being replaced by another from barbarian tribes did they revolt.#"
goan_desc:0 "#size:15    The Goans passed through the Black Gate with Cenware, though are not, themselves, Sjalvolki. They originate from atop a mountain range, having survived the altitude since the distant past. Goan dwellings were carved into cliffsides, many having stood longer than the tribes that lived in them, with some even claiming that these dwellings had been theirs since the beginning of time. They once herded goats upon the heights, and would periodically war amongst themselves over the few productive pastures to be found in the mountains. The sheer peaks of their homeland isolated them from the outside world, and they were only vaguely aware of it.  \n\nThis would end with the [frodbrokna|E], when their dwellings collapsed, their pastures split open, and rocks began to rain from the sky. Forced to unite, they began an exodus from the mountains, where they would encounter the burgeoning host of Cenware, joining him in his invasion of [aversaria|E]. With their homeland now lost to them, the Goans now face an unfamiliar world, torn between a desire to seek out mountains and resume their ancient ways, or embrace the pastures and fertile plains of their new lands.#"

They are almost entirely farmers, with their vast fields providing sustenance for much of the Marches. Their lands have often been battlefields, the repeated civil wars and [lich|E] invasions having touched nearly everywhere they inhabit. These threats have united them, forming a culture where collaboration and community are prized. \n\nTheir close internal ties have only strengthened the perception of the rest of Chevalie, that the Trustians are meant to follow, not lead. Though others may prize strong leadership, they seek stability, as the rest of the nation tears itself apart repeatedly over ambition, they continue their lives. Though they inhabit many of the poorest regions of the Marches, partially on account of the wars fought upon its ground, they are content with their lot. Whatever fate awaits Chevalie, the Trustians will stand together against it, as they have so many times before.#"

But to their own kin, they are the chosen people who liberated mankind from the chains of the Titan Mawloc by feasting upon his body. Ever since, the Kardwen have continued the hunt of those unfortunate enough to wander into their ancestral homeland. To those who have not seen them with their own eyes, they are mere nightmares, spirits which the elders warn the curious children about. \n\nThe Kardwen are proud hunters, devouring the bodies of their enemies and trespassers, except for their heads, as that is where the soul resides, instead they are worn as testaments to ones ability as a warrior or as decorations in a war-chief’s hall. As long as the head remains, they are unable to enter the afterlife and feast amongst the gods, forever stuck peering out of their own hollow eyes. However, the days of head-hunters have become a distant memory, strange folk from the east have displaced the slayers of Mawloc. The Kardwen have had to seek refuge amongst those who they once called prey, torn between keeping to their traditions now they are no longer sheltered amongst the trees, or adapting and learning to live alongside those they once hunted.#"

When winter came to their northern pastures, they would march their livestock further south, bartering their quality fleece for tools and weapons. Their true calling, however, would be to venture forth from their simple abodes to foreign lands in search of glory and plunder - whether through payment for their services on the battlefield, or more usually, taking it themselves.\n\nThe Fenvir were among the first to witness the madness of [the_fog|E] descend from their hills, but due to their already semi-nomadic lifestyle faced much less of a shock upon confronting the prospect of leaving their highlands forever.#"

It is a matter of some debate how much, if any of modern Marcher culture has its roots in the peoples it replaced. While the ancient Epic of King Bastione narrates that the founder of Chevalie and his heroic knights fought momentous battles to secure a home free from the wicked Gallieni, there is also evidence that many of the cornerstones of Marcher custom and tradition were adopted from these precursor peoples, suggesting that not all contact between the two may have been so aggressive.\n\nRegardless of the truth of the events that transpired during that legendary age, the Gallicads today only persist in pockets amongst the hills and mountains, marginal land spared Marcher settlement only due to its poor, rocky soil and the stubbornness of its inhabitants. There they dwell, continuing the traditions of their ancestors in reclusive communities. Their society is segmented into hierarchical castes which determine the specific roles and careers an individual may pursue throughout life."
adrakamp_desc:0 "#size:15    The northern lowlands were home to some of the most metropolitan Sjalvolki societies, the Adrakamp key among them. Merchants from across all clans flocked to their settlements in hopes of selling their wares, anything a tribesman might need could be found in an Adrakamp market. This prosperity was largely born from their strategic location upon the crossroads of the region's major riverine trade routes, and the driving necessity to keep the wealth flowing taught the Adrakamp chieftains the subtle art of diplomacy to avoid the more bloody aspects of Sjalvolki clan politics. Instead of fighting for territory, the Adrakamp were called to mediate disputes between rival tribes, and Adrakamp towns were neutral ground for the purposes of commerce and diplomacy, with blood feuds and vendettas becoming legally null the moment a clansman crossed into their territory. This is not to say these mercantile clans were craven, when attacked the Adrakamp would defend themselves as would be expected of any other Sjalvolki.\n\nHowever, the Adrakamp could not defend themselves from all threats.

rivarisians_desc:0 "#size:15    Nestled between the Konijkmener and the Chevaliens, the Rivarisians have long made a living traversing the canals and rivers between the two. Though originally kin of the Konijkmener, they have become more Chevalien over the centuries, integrating aspects of both into a unique blend. They place a strong emphasis on the water, with fishing becoming a replacement for farming in many settlements, and trade along the water being their main form of interaction with the world outside of their swamps. The construction of canals in the region was welcomed by the Rivarisians, who would rapidly integrate into the trade along them, filling roles from captains to dockworkers. \n\nDue to their position between realms, the Rivarisians are a melting pot of Konijkmener and Chevalien traditions, language, and beliefs. Their language is famously indecipherable, integrating a variety of stolen phrases and words into a nonsensical grammatical structure. To the Chevaliens, the Rivarisians are more Konijkmener than Chevalien, and looked down upon heavily, while few among the Konijkmener care how some sailors to the north speak.

Prior to their migration, they had existed for centuries as a group of tribes, fighting amongst themselves over resources and grudges. This age of internal conflict would be brought to an end by the Ethylisiads, who would conquer and enslave them. Over their centuries of oppression, the Shewigads would learn the ways of civilization from their masters, beginning their metamorphosis. Eventually, they would rise against their masters, though who exactly led them in this is unclear. Some claim that “Sir Ranos”, the figure who supposedly led them in rebellion, is nothing more than a fairy tale, while others claim that Ranos was simply Bastione. \n\nNonetheless, it is known that after their revolt, Bastione would unify them, and lead them westward into the lands now known as Chevalie. The native Gallicads would be conquered through a series of wars, leaving the land open for their settlement. Over the centuries since, the Shewigads have mixed with the Gallicads, forming into the people of modern Chevalie.

Because of this the Urdermantern are known as expert fishermen, and from a young age learn the art of sailing.\n\nDue to the underdeveloped economy of their homeland, many Urdermantern as of late have left their native marshes seeking economic opportunity elsewhere.

Once upon a time they were ascendant, overlords of a great kingdom composed of other southern Sjalvolki tribes forced into paying tribute. They were ruled by the Teyberl Kings, and in contrast to modern Sjalvolki theology insisted that it was the god of fate who was foremost among the pantheon, for it was he who commanded Velos to grant man his gifts and their stipulations. In practice the functional differences caused by this alteration were few outside of basic rituals, but while the Teyberl Kings were strong it allowed them to justify their role as paramount clan. Times were good.\n\nAnd then the Teyberl Kings fell to squabbling amongst themselves. The Great Kingdom of the Greulokin was lost in just one generation of strife as its tributaries revolted, and its ruling clans were forced to moderate their pride. Still, the Greulokin carry on practicing their oddly reorganized pantheon, and they have never forgotten that they were once kings among men."
ashital_desc:0 "size:15   The Ashital are the most prosperous and largest division of the Canian people, their society centered around the two great metropoli of Shenidad and Bet-Adis. The two cities' people have produced the bulk of Canian literature and culture, but neither have enjoyed more than fleeting periods of independence from the outside powers which have often dominated them throughout the centuries. While this has culminated in a number of revolts and ensuing attempts to suppress their odd religious practices, fear of disrupting the lucrative commerce flowing through the region has led to the cities usually enjoying a tenuous local autonomy.\n\nThe Ashital, despite being what most outsiders think of when they imagine a Canian, have absorbed a number of cultural practices from their Ayyar and Amsari neighbors. Many have come to take pride in their cosmopolitan heritage, and hold a belief that they are the most cultured and literate people in West Sarradon."
leviden_desc:0 "size:15   The drier environs and distance from any commercially valuable river systems mean that the Leviden never achieved the same level of prosperity as their Ashital cousins to the south. Nevertheless they are a hardy people, and have successfully harnessed the Four Rivers of Kabyar to turn significant portions of their territory into fertile, farmable land. Unfortunately this also made the region a target for foreign aggression, and in IS 615 the disunited Leviden kingdoms were brought under the rule of the Amsari Hiklahn. While they are far from slaves, the Leviden people have lost considerable ground in the ensuing centuries to Zaoranian settlers.\n\nLeviden culture tends to be more isolationist and conservative than their Ashital relatives, whom some even go so far as to accuse of having abandoned Canian practices and the religion of Eloi. Leviden villages often appear as clustered houses formed into a fortified compound, both to emphasize their clannish separation from the outside world and to defend against Ran Kemsari raiders ranging far down the dry Iteru riverbed."
simevian_desc:0 "size:15   The smallest of the three Canian cultures, the Simevians are the nomadic people of old Kabyar, traditionally eschewing permanent settlement for a more itinerant lifestyle. While the Ashital and even the Leviden tend to regard their wayward cousins as little better than savages, in truth the lines between settled 'civilized' farmers and wandering 'barbarian' herders tend to be blurred in the margins of rural society. When farming is no longer an option many Canian agriculturalists fall back on nomadism with their goats and sheep to survive. Thus, a surprising number of Simevian clansmen are in reality only a generation or two removed from their settled brethren.\n\nThey are a devout people, and though their settled cousins may sneer at their parochialism they are renowned for their poetry and notorious for their resourcefulness. As their identity is in large part built from their hard-bitten lifestyle as opposed to any geographical origin, adoption of outsiders and even slaves into Simevian clans is a widespread practice, and those who are so adopted can rise far if they ambitious."

Before the Imperrech led them out into the wider world they never had cause to adopt permanent settlements nor to become farmers, instead eking out an existence as nomadic hunters and reindeer herders in a harsh land. Their tools and weapons were often made of simple bone and stone since their lands were barren of any accessible metal deposits, and most Cugerski tribes were too poor for many traders to bother with. Because of this they were derided as savage and primitive by their fellow Sjalvolki.\n\nNow settled in former Aversarian territory they have slowly adopted some of the trappings of the more 'civilized' clans, but the old ways do not die easy.

At no point however did they earn the full trust of the Aversarians, with Barki guides' duplicity being suspected as the cause of the Chorres Massacre in IS 1067, and the bloodless and embarrassing failure of the punitive Ichiteron campaign in IS 1086.

Cut off from the rest of Sjalvolki society, their language and customs became alien to those they once called brethren, incorporating yelps, howls and whistles into their tongue in order to take full advantage of their home's natural acoustics. Their isolation did not last forever. Greulokin marauders arrived, seeking to seize the region’s rich mineral deposits for themselves. Despite numbering thrice as many as their overlords, the inhospitable terrain of their homeland and fractious nature of their clans rendered it impossible to release the Greulokin yoke.

In ancient days, when Velos’ gift was new, he made their ancestors swear an oath that whenever harm was done, they would reverse it upon its perpetrators. The leader of those who accepted this oath was named Irmi, and so would his tribe be called the People of Irmi, or Irmionoth. \n\nSeeking to uphold this contract, they began training, becoming ever more skilled at the arts of war. When the tribe was wronged, they would descend upon their enemy with a fury unmatched, and avenge every perceived slight. Internally, they held to a simple code, that everything must be proportional. If one were to be caught thieving, they would be required to return something of equal value in addition to the stolen goods. A feud would require the rivals to battle to the death, and so they were only invoked at harsh transgressions.

Seen as a 'civilised tribe' by their [aversarian|e] overlords, they were used as an engineered middle class in the colonial settlements which sprung up all over the Iyrossi Basin. Despite this the Cerussiai were never quite absorbed into imperial stock, partly due to [aversarian|e] efforts to keep the two groups distinct and there own to keep their own traditions alive. The Cerussiai were afforded liberties which their Iyrossi brethren did not, and enjoyed the benefits of it, however now the tables have turned, time wil see what becomes of the 'civlised tribe'.#"

The Auteonics hold pine trees in particular regard, settling in the northernmost reaches of Partic lands. They carefully grew a forest of pine from a barren field, and most spent their entire lives within it. Upon the death of a pine tree, they would carefully cut it down, burning it after a funeral service. \n\nPerhaps the most isolated of the Partic tribes, the Auteonics jealously guarded the boundaries of their forest, and few outsiders had ever seen into its depths. By the time of [frodbrokna|E], even their language had begun to drift from their fellow treespeakers. With the warning of their forest, the Auteonics left their sacred lands behind, fleeing southwards with Cenware’s coalition. Yet pines do not grow in these new lands, and the Auteonics are left adrift.#"

However, the matter of which trees to heed would eventually split them into distinct tribes, each following the guidance of different types. The Brigandines revere conifer trees, with their tribe having once been saved by one’s guidance. According to oral tradition, their old home had once burned, an event that would surely have led to their demise were it not for the interference of a conifer, who warned them of the danger. In honor of the tree’s heroism, they chose to dedicate themselves to its brethren, who would lead them to a new home. \n\nThe Brigandine Forest, however, consisted of a wide variety of trees, with the conifers only making up a small portion. Each of their settlements was built around a conifer tree, and upon its death a new one would be planted. Forced to flee from the [fog|E], the Brigandines have found Aversarian forests to similar to their homes, and have begun settling in their traditional manner, seeking out conifers around which to build homes.#"

However, the matter of which trees to heed would eventually split them into distinct tribes, each following the guidance of different types. The Voluntics were the southernmost Partics, seeing birch trees as their guides. They served as the most militaristic of the tribes, guarding the great forests from various outsiders. The only wood permitted to be used to make a weapon was birch, as they believed it would channel the power of the tree. The cutting of a tree to make weapons was a momentous event, only occurring as old wood rotted or in the most dire of emergencies. \n\nAs the southern edge of the Partics, the Voluntics were the first to learn of the [fog|E], As they marched into Aversaria, however, they abandoned Cenware’s coalition, instead moving northwards into the Marches. What exactly they hope to find there is unclear, though whispers abound of another seam, upon which their magi can bring miracles to life.#"
amharian_desc:0 "#size:15    The Amhari people have long existed within the Damota Valley, having once built a great empire within it. This empire, however, eventually collapsed, fragmenting the region into petty kingdoms. Once its rulers, the Amhari now inhabit the southernmost reaches of the region, pushed against the jungles and mountains that mark its edge. They have remained closest to the old ways, with their social structures arranged in the same way as before the empire. It is highly encouraged to join a "rayakuux", a group dedicated to journeying, and to travel with them for a period of time, to understand more of the world. \n\nBeyond this journey, members of a rayakuux are expected to assist their fellows wherever they find them, and can expect the same aid should they need it. Most people will marry within their rayakuux, settling down somewhere along its routes, and their children will likely join the same group. Rayakuux also have a role in politics, with many of the region’s rulers being members, funding mass expeditions and drawing upon their knowledge. The variance between rayakuux are massive, with some being little more than social clubs in a small village, and others being kingdom-spanning networks, their members being found across Amhari lands.#"
kutma_desc:0 "#size:15    The smallest of the Damotan cultures, the history of the Kutma is one of defiance, lined with heroes who never gave in to superior odds. As a result of this, they have formed a proud warrior culture, whose impact is present throughout daily life. One’s loyalty is first and foremost to their "waranuux", or “spear group”, a system which has evolved to form the basis of their society. Waranuux operate as the primary political and social unit in addition to their military role, filling a space normally reserved for kin in other societies. \n\nThe waranuux consists of everyone who has ever fought as part of the group, and each maintains proud records of its great deeds. At the age of fourteen, a child is expected to join one, as adulthood is not reached until they have fought beside their brothers and sisters. After seeing a single battle, or training for 6 years, one may choose to put down the spear, instead filling one of the many other roles in society, though they will still retain close bonds to their waranuux, and can be called up by it in times of war. Those who do not lay down arms will instead continue to train, preparing to lead their brothers against whatever may come.#"
fedagesh_desc:0 "#size:15    Inhabiting the northern plains of Damota, Fedegesh society is oriented around a type of social group known as a "qabuux", consisting of a group of families. Within a qabuux, bonds are as tight as those between family members, and most live within large communal dwellings, commonly situated at the center of a shared farm. These large farms are worked by everyone who is a member of the qabuux unless they generate income through some other means. \n\nMarriage between qabuux is common, and traditionally the couple becomes a part of the smaller group, as they need the extra hands. Within a qabuux, marriage also takes place, and blood relations, commonly ignored, are taken into account. Qabuux have effectively become a political unit, with exchanges of land common between them in more populous regions, and many of the region’s rulers can trace their lineage to a humble farmer, whose descendents managed to accumulate enough land to begin to truly wield power. The original large dwellings of these rulers have long since been converted into fortresses, however the qabuux structure remains intact, with the top positions within their realms filled by their families. To be without a qabuux in Fedagesh society is to be an exile, and most choose to take their own lives rather than face such a fate.#"
doffore_desc:0 "#size:15    The only one of the Damotan cultures to have a connection to the outside world, the Doffore are heavily influenced by the caravan trade over the desert. Every person within their society is a member of a caravaneer group, known as "karavuux" even if they have never left their homes, as the karavuux consist of their entire supply chain. A farmer is a member, as a portion of his food is sold to the traders. An artisan is a member, as their goods are carried upon the karavuux. The king is a member, for their power comes from the wealth of the karavuux. \n\nThough there are a sizable number of karavuux, few have true political influence. The basis of their economy on trade has required the karavuux to invest heavily in winning the support of those who produce their wares, and a portion of the profits made do actually go to benefitting the people, as the karavuux engage in bidding wars over contested towns. Though one is expected to remain with their karavuux for life, the actual structure of this system is far less rigid than those of their neighbors, and switching in pursuit of a better life is common.#"
amsari_desc:0"#size:15    Few peoples have endured such enslavement and oppression as have the Amsari, and fewer still have done so and survived.\n\nFrom the dark days of slavery at the hands of the Ran Kemsari the Amsari have risen far. It was their prophet who foretold the freedom of the Zarasadari peoples, and their warriors and magi who made good on that promise of liberation. Every Amsari child learns this from birth, and as a result their culture has developed a deep and abiding pride in their status as free men and women. The very idea of enslavement is considered abhorrent to their society, something born of a nightmare conjured out of the darkest days of their history. Legally, any slave who remains on Amsari soil when the sun sets is immediately rendered free - though actual enforcement of this law upon those foreign merchants foolish enough to bring their slaves with them has been lax at best."

thyssae_desc:0"#size:15    The Thyssae are a hardy and warlike people dwelling in the upper river valley. They have a proud history, and largely consider themselves no less than equals of their downriver Amsari cousins. Often serving as the first line of defense against Ran Kemsari raiders, they have developed a robust martial tradition. Every man and woman from the age of thirteen who can be spared from fieldwork is expected to be trained to fight with a spear, and many Thyssae towns are heavily fortified. Because of this, when Amsari Hiklhan armies march to war, their ranks are often swelled with Thyssae recruits. On the other hand, this manpower has also meant that the Thyssae have been able to assert de facto independance from the rest of the Amsari on no less than two occasions during times of extreme crisis for the Qanamsar, both periods lasted for the better part of a century before control was restored."
sycharcegs_desc:0 "#size:15   The Sycharcegs are the most like the Old Kikarsagi; the bötai, a sort of warrior lodge, is central to Sycharceg society. Young men are obligated to join a böta, otherwise they are ostracized and are ineligible for marriage. Youths are only considered adults when they kill an enemy, though this can include prisoners and criminals. Before the [frodbrokna|E], bötai were used as auxiliaries in the eastern legions, though now they hunt for [aversarians|E] to kill so that they may become Chosen Men.\n\nLike all Kikarsagi cultures, the concept of 'ardara', or honor, is held in high regard. To the Sycharcegs, to have ardara is to be brave in combat, to slaughter one's enemies and their people, and to be pure of blood. Purity of blood is gained through killing enemies and the impure; formerly these were the enemies of [aversaria|E], but now the [aversarians|E] themselves must be slain to attain purity.\n\n[magi|E] in general and [blood_magi|E] in particular hold great power in Sycharceg society, serving mainly as a priestly class. [magic|E] ability is viewed as a sign of possessing the favor of the gods, and [magi|E] are treated accordingly, though [dead_magi|E] are persecuted for being 'impure'. Human sacrifice - previously shunned by the Old Kikarsagi - is viewed as acceptable for the purposes of magic. Sycharceg horsemen are among the best in the world, and it is said that they use banners of human skin in place of cloth."
csorsca_desc:0 "#size:15   The Csorsca are the least like the Old Kikarsagi; their nobility speak Imperial and their own native language, which is itself somewhat intelligible with the Imperial tongue. The bötai - Kikarsagi warrior lodges - are subordinated to a class of [magi|E] in a pseudo-[aversarian|E] fashion, with each böta being ran like a legion in miniature. Csorsca youths - both men and women - must join a böta to be considered an adult. The Csorsca concept of ardara - honor - revolves around obedience to [magi|E] and the pureblooded, along with prowess in [magic|E]. The purer one's blood and the more powerful a [magi|E] one is, the more ardara they possess. Before the [frodbrokna|E], the Csorsca held the [aversarians|E] as the purest of all men, but after the dissolution of [aversaria|E] they have come to the conclusion that they must take and uphold the Mandate of Purity.\n\nCsorsca society is strongly tied to its [magi|E]-kings, who reign in [aversarian|E] fashion and who wear a combination of [aversarian|E] and Kikarsagi clothing. Csorsca place a high importance on [blood_magi|E], and have mostly surrendered their prejudices against [dead_magi|E], though they still believe them to be spiritually inferior to [blood_magi|E].\n\nCsorsca horsemen are renowned for their discipline and were fielded in [aversarian|E] legions as auxiliaries, though now they turn that discipline against their former masters to become the Chosen Men."
kunsag_desc:0 "#size:15   The Kunsag are the most ferocious of the Kikarsagi cultures, and are middling in [aversarian|E] influence. The bötai - a form of Kikarsagi warrior lodge - are central to Kunsag culture; youths must join a böta and take the head of a foeman (who may be a prisoner) to be considered an adult. This 'cult of the head' features prominently in Kunsag culture, and originates from [aversarian|E] lords deploying Kunsag horsemen to crush slave revolts, as the [aversarians|E] would pay them for each head collected.\n\nThe Kunsag conception of ardara - honor - revolves around how many heads one has claimed; the more heads one has, the more ardara they possess. Kunsag warriors often have skulls tied to their belts and horses, and sometimes incorporate their skull collections into their clothing.\n\n[magi|E] serve an important role in Kunsag society, acting mainly as spiritual leaders, they may also be rulers of a clan. The ability to use [magic|E] is seen as a gift from the gods, with [blood_magi|E] gaining their powers from the Purest, while [dead_magi|E] gain their powers from Eru-Mai the Impure, and are persecuted for their [magic|E]. Kunsag horsemen are renowned for their fearlessness and near-suicidal bravery; warriors who retreat from disastrous battles are expected to command their heirs to cut off their heads, while soldiers who surrender are exsanguinated."
atrakar_desc:0 "#size:15   The Atrakar were the last of the Old Kikarsagi to surrender, and so were punished by the [aversarians|E] with clan extermination. Though they adopted [aversarian|E] trappings like their cultural kinsmen, in secret they maintain a cult of personality worshiping Nartakhatan Ozkan and his wife Nartahatun Betun, their last independent rulers and culture heroes who chose death over surrender.\n\nThe Atrakaran conception of ardara is loyalty to Ozkan and Betun; because their dynasty was exterminated, this loyalty is shown mainly through emulating them and battling against their enemies, the Iyrossi and the [aversarians|E]. As both Ozkan and Betun exemplified the Old Kikarsagi ideal of ardara, the Atrakaran conception of it is very similar.\n\nLike all Kikarsagi cultures, the bötai is an important part of Atrakaran society; in emulation of Ozkan and Betun, both men and women must join a böta and participate in a raid to be considered an adult and eligible for marriage. Atrakar horsemen - famed for their ferocity - were used by [aversarian|E] lords to terrorize rebellious slaves, and after the [frodbrokna|E] they now terrorize and slaughter [aversarians|E].\n\n[magic|E] is mainly relegated to spiritual roles, though there is no prohibition against secular rulers being [magi|E].

daukeni_desc:0 "#size:15  Hailing from the Sjalvolki heartlands where it is neither too hot nor cold, and where the game is plentiful, the Daukeni have never felt that the gods' gifts to mankind have ever been far from sight. Arranged into numerous clans the Daukeni were led by those who proved themselves chief among their peers, either through physical prowess, skill in the hunt, or even storytelling. Delmex 'Two-Eyes', Menwir 'Woodwolf' and Arnold 'Toadface' all names of cheiftains, whose heroic exploits have become the stuff of legend told and retold in the many Sagas of the Daukeni People. One of these great Sagas tells of the origin of the Daukeni themselves, tracing their people, to the first man to ever use a bow. Felling a great bear which had terrorised his village for generations, with a single arrow to the head, upon butchering the mountain of a beast, he found a beautiful woman trapped within its stomach, the daughter of a cheiftain, who had been devoured whole many moons ago, the two married their line becoming the Daukeni of today. Daukeni warriors were known for their lightning fast ambushes upon unsuspecting [aversarian|e] legions, a battle with minimal casualties was favoured by Daukeni leaders, as they preffered their men to stay alive and provide for their family, instead of dying an avoidable death, although mocked by other tribes and seen as cowards, this tactic worked well against the strict and regimented [aversarians|e], slow to react to raids coming from all sides and even above.\n\n However, a new threat has pushed the Daukeni far from their bountiful homeland, the encroaching [fog|e] united the Sjalvolki for the first time in their history, under a single banner, the banner of Cenware "Witch-Breaker" perhaps a new cheiftain to be added to the long and prestigous list of the Daukeni.#"

Though [magi|E] are not the majority within these regions, their importance in local practices cannot be understated. \n\nThe term “Practitioner” originates from a group of administrators, who coined it as a shorthand for the [mayikprolollan|E]’s members. Over time, the [magi|E] began to spread it to their inferiors, in an attempt to cultivate a loyal following. This has been largely successful, creating a culture that exists to serve [magic|E] above all else. Those who wield it are to be raised above society, and to serve those with it is the noblest calling, for it raises one closer to their glory. Due to this exaltation, many Practitioners will avoid pursuing advancement, with the idea of [magi|E] supremacy having been reinforced for their whole lives.#"
salisians_desc:0 "#size:15    The inhabitants of eastern Chevalie, the Salisians are the descendants of many of the first Shewigad settlers in the region. In some ways, they are the closest to the ancient Shewigads, having violently expelled the Gallicaders in ancient times. Only tasked with guarding a short border with the Lichdoms, the Salisians instead turned towards other pursuits. Fueled by investments from the ever-feuding church and nobility, the Salisians began developing advanced artisanal skills, especially in the realm of metalworking, with the nearby mountains serving as a source of material. With centuries of practice, they would reach a point where their weapons were superior to all those produced within the Marches, cementing themselves as the "Forge of Chevalie". \n\nThis prestigious position has become ingrained in their culture, with a level of reverence shown to craftspeople comparable to that shown to Anti-Magi. It is heavily encouraged for a child to try their hand at an apprenticeship, and as such they are quite difficult to come across. When the Marchers go to war, they arm themselves with Salisian weaponry, and when they build they use Salisian glass and stone. They may not be glorious, but to Chevalie, the Salisians are critically important.#"

Because of this the Warisnik were known as skilled hunters, similar to their more primitive Curgerski cousins to the north. However primordial their lands seemed however the Warisnik were a settled people, living in fortified wooden settlements on the boundaries of the tundra. Their brave chiefs would lead hunting expeditions out on the plains bringing back all manner of strange tusks and pelts. While in halls decorated with mammoth bone brave warriors would tell tales of the fearsome beasts they met. The Warisnik eventually learned to tame some of these beasts, and the occasional working mammoth or leashed sabrecat would not be out of place in a Warisnik camp.\n\nToday the Warisnik are a mournful people, their camps filled with songs and legends of their lost home.
