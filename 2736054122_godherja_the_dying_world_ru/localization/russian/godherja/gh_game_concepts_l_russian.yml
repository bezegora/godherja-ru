The soul of a powerful [magi|E] trapped within an unliving body, Liches are generally accepted to be the most poweful [magi|E] of the world. Having mastered Dead Magic in order to perform the Thirteen Steps, a lack of any understanding of right and wrong (or a lack of care) and unlimited time to study arcana means that each one is a caster of unbelievable power.\n\nThe first Lich was [vilas_venslau|E], who performed the [sorrowing_of_oejeynica|E] and established the [lichdoms|E] in the far north. He soon after embarked upon the first Black March, invading south in an attempt to extend his dominion upon all living beings (and presumably to turn them undead in order to better worship him.)\n\nLiches generally share several personality traits. The reason why is hotly debated, whether it is some aftershock from the ceremony to become a Lich or from only a certain type of person being willing to do so, or perhaps an endless life among the dead pushing a soul towards a certain kind of insanity. Regardless of the reasons, the list of shared traits can be found [shared_lich_personalities_here|E].\n\nDue to boredom, Liches often change their identities every few hundred years, and generally take what they see as 'beautiful' and 'powerful' names through alliteration."

Deceitful: [liches|E] have little sense of morality, and will gladly employ any method they see as necessary to achieve their goals.

Further exacerbating this was a large civil war that quickly broke out between the governors of Kalathipsomi and Malcois in the midst of the invasions.\n\nNot long after, the [bloodblight|E] began its rampage across the world from [aversaria|E]. With the southwest weakened from these calamities, the Kartharadd Imperium launched a massive invasion into [aversaria|E] and conquered most of Malcois, only being beaten back after a brutal near fifty years of war which ended with the defeat of the last Kartharaddi army at the Battle of the Riduvian Barrows in 760 IS, marking the end of the Chaos."

Most notable of them was the main academy in the mountains, from which most others were administered. This is the academy most often referred to when people refer to 'the' Mayikprolollan.\n\nThe Mayikprolollan was technically independent of imperial control, though was loosely held as part of the Aautokrata. Students from any walk of life and even homeland were allowed within, though they would either have to pay a hefty amount for a seat or show enough talent in an entrance test. While in the Mayikprolollan, new students are apprenticed to a resident Magi who creates a curriculum with them based on a variety of classes, lectures, and labs.\n\nStudents may attend a Mayikrpolollan for up to ten years or until 26 years of age. Every year, tournaments are held to decide the most promising student in attendance—an extremely prestigious title—and which students are not worthy of holding a seat in the academy. Historically, the long attendance of students and connection with their mentors has been used by the Mayikprolollan to control numerous puppets in the world's nobility, and with the collapse of the Aautokrata, the Mayikprolollan's soon after declared independence."

With the death of the High King, his family, the extinction of several of the most important noble houses in [chevalie|E] and the devastation of most others, all law and order in the realm collapsed. The proceeding anarchy left all power in the hands of minor lords and city leaders, who quickly began warring with one another over old debts or attempts to reunite [chevalie|E].\n\nFive kingdoms eventually emerged from the chaos, though dozens more still claimed independence, and would battle one another for the final twenty years of the Anarchy. Kings of the families of Montegon, Valadec, Illurdian, Den va Pontaget and Den va Seignon families would further torture the land in the war; and the [antimagic_orders|E] would regularly join the highest bidder as mercenaries.

The massacre effectively ended the lineage of the Demonteaux, Klemendair and Viligad noble families, along with two dozen other minor ones, and led to the deaths of nearly every high noble and dynastic head in [chevalie|E]. Thamean himself would kill himself in his throne room soon after in a maddened display, and the historical account is unclear if Thamean meant to cut his wrists deep enough to bleed to death or if it was an accident. Popular tales say that he could have been saved, but his knights were too afeared and ashamed of their High King to do so, and killed themselves soon after to avenge their High King.\n\nThe massacre, besides the murders themselves, caused much controversy for the use of mercenaries leased from the [antimagic_orders|E] for it. Thamean, not trusting his own men to do the deed, instead paid hefty sums to the various holy orders own mercenary companies in order to do it for him and ensure that military forces would not be able to stop them. The reputations of the Orders would be tarnished, and would not be recovered until the end of the [red_river_war|E] and the sacrifice of [champion_of_chevalie|E], the Orders soon after declaring neutrality in Marcher politics and focusing their mercenary work abroad."

While extremely wealthy in minerals, commerce, and culture, multiple devastating events have led to large depopulation and famine across most of the continent. Most notably the use of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] in 802 IS that wiped out over 80% of the northern portion of the continent's Magi and most of the ruling class, leading to mass anarchy that soon after led to the Agionist and [aversarian|E] colonization of the region.\n\nTo the far south of the continent, tales tell of the Axoquilekko Empire which has been bitterly fighting the Adabyssians for hundreds of years.

The First Warden claimed to have seen visions of the Dead God while imprisoned by the warlord Arachas in the eastern Isle and his revolt first targeted Arachas so that Wardenites may protect what they saw as the material prison of their Dead God.\n\nThe attacks by The First Warden were the opening battles of the [war_in_heaven|E], which would proceed to consume [sarradon|E] for near 2000 years.\n\nIt is hotly debated whether or not Wardenism was originally a sect of [ritualism|E].

The event had its origins in a satirical poem of unknown origin that began circulating early in the same year, its contents making a mockery of each Saintly Order, but also venting the accrued grievances of 70 years of [aversarian|E] rule. Dikansynite attempts to locate the author were thwarted repeatedly until, several months later, they claimed to have found the culprit.\n\nIn a curious show of seemingly extending a hand of cooperation to the locals, they invited leading, respected Sophocist judges to attend the trial as well, and help with the passing of justice. The native jurists, hoping to use the occasion to seek audience with their overlords, were shocked upon arrival to discover that they were all, in fact, the ones on trial. The ensuing bloodbath would begin on the balconies of the great Dikansynite hall of judgement, but would soon spread across Agionist-controlled [sarradon|E]. An entire generation of scholars, jurists and priests would perish in the purge, numerous [ritualist|E] temples would be demolished, and books beyond count consigned to the flame. Ironically, the very same Dikansynite judges responsible for the butchery would later be put on trial themselves and executed for 'numerous procedural errors' in the process.\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the event would be severe. Any hope of peaceful coexistence between the Agionists and locals would die, and going forward, the stability of their rule would gradually deteriorate until the outbreak of the [faghira_jalil_revolt|E] a little over 10 years later."

The dinner would, instead, end with the Sansianites pulling daggers on their hosts and butchering the entire Hudi royal dynasty. After the city gates were opened from within, the bloodshed continued on the streets for hours, until the Agionists promised an end to the battle and honorable treatment for those still in hiding. The 'honorable treatment' would turn out to be gathering all the survivors on a nearby hill, and bloodletting them to death. The attrocity was not limited to the city itself, and in the coming months, what can only be described as an attempt by the Sansianites to utterly destroy the Hudi people wherever they found them ensued, causing a mass exodus to the lands of the Mamuramat south. In all, anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 perished in the mayhem.\n\nThe event, naturally, incited outrage across the continent, and the final crystallization of feelings among the locals that the threat the Saintly Orders posed to their very existence outweighted any petty feuds or regional squabbles that prevented their cooperation."

The act proved to be a breaking point for the locals, who proceeded to retaliate by burning down their local chapter of the order. A series of escalations by both sides then ensued, culminating in a massive wave of rebellion spreading across the land.\n\nThe war has received its name from the two primary leaders of the [sarradonian|E] forces - the [ritualist|E] priest Faghira in the west, and the [wardenite|E] preacher Jalil in the east.

Secular lords had great interest in being able to either decide their subjects' Path or remove any ability to determine it altogether, while the clergy wished to be able to choose in order to control the lords and commoners both.\n\nLong conflicts over the concept and other conflicts of interest effectively ended in the 821 IS Concordate of Theyslaux, an agreement by the [chevalien|E] Kings at the time that the ultimate Right of Choice rested with the clergy. This (along with the rise of northern bureucratic systems) led to an increasing codification of the clergy’s rights to control [chevalien|E] society, with the clergy often going so far as to use their power to have noble lords replaced with their chosen successors.\n\nConflict between the clergy and secular lords was increasingly common, culminating in the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E] in 878 IS, along with [the_brutality|E]. With the clergy splitting along secular lines and supporting various Kings, and the [antimagic_orders|E] serving as mercenaries to the highest bidder, trust in the secular functions of the clergy plummeted.\n\nAfter the [red_river_war|E], in the name of the honor of the [Concept('champion_of_chevalie','Champion of Chevalie')|E], the various [antimagic_orders|E] swore to the ‘Rites of Noncompliance’, which stated that the Orders would no longer meddle in domestic [Concept('marcher','chevalien')|E] affairs. The similar ‘Orders of Separation’ formally broke the [antimagic_orders|E] off of the Conclave of Raocourt’s jurisdiction. With their militant branch now independent and with little good will among the nobility and the peasantry both, the Conclave and clergy at large struggled to maintain control of their flock.\n\nThe end of the Conclave's influence would come with the [war_of_the_heretic_princes|E], where it had lost the majority of its church lands in the conflicts thanks to the opportunism of secular lords, and would never again come close to the amount of control it exerted over [chevalie|E] thereafter. The next High King to reunite [chevalie|E] after the event, Oliërs den va Hadcourte-Vedron, would famously require the assorted Wayfather’s to prostrate themselves and request the right to crown him, a controversial yet clear sign that the function of the clergy would officially be secondary to that of the hereditary nobility."

game_concept_war_of_the_heretic_princes_desc:0 "The War of the Heretic Princes (or The Heresies) was a massive wave of heretical thought in [chevalie|E] that nearly ended a near millennia of uninterrupted worship of the ‘[lifepath|E]’.\n\nThe wars were a result of a long history of [clerical_control_of_chevalie|E] that came to a head in 999 IS when the preacher Urso Becledièvre declared several ‘accompaniments’ to the interpretation of the [lifepath|E] and began preaching for radical changes from mainline thought. While clerical soldiers initially tried having him arrested, soldiers of the Duke of Sauvessagne guarded Urso and then Duke Michel Frink used this new religious conflict to declare himself free from the Conclave of Raocourt and his responsibilities to the church, reclaiming the [Concept('clerical_control_of_chevalie','Right of Choice')|E] and imprisoning any Wayfather who refused to give him full control of clerical lands and functions.\n\nThe event was widely circulated across [chevalie|E], and new faiths by emboldened preachers began appearing almost monthly. Secular warlords were fast to use these new faiths to secure their rule, and the situation deteriorated so quickly that it is credited with causing the collapse of the Deyvidian High Kingdom shortly after its reunification.\n\nWhile the Conclave was slow to react and struggled to find its footing after such a great challenge, it finally began a true response in 1011 IS with the Council of Ex and its declaration of Becledièvre and any other mendicant preachers as arch-heretics, as well as officially declaring the crime of attempting to disrupt the Waypath worthy of death. This would begin nearly forty years of religious warfare across [chevalie|E], which would finally end in the Agreement of Raocourt, which saw the various religious leaders either executed, exiled, or returned to the fold, and the secular warlords once again swearing themselves to [lifepath|E] orthodoxy. Despite the Conclave’s victory, however, the long history of [clerical_control_of_chevalie|E] was effectively over."

game_concept_chevalie_migratory_era_desc:0 "The Migratory Era of [marcher|E] history (not to be confused with the much later, [sjalvolki_migrations|E] of the 13th century) refers to the period in which the proto-Chevaliens first arrived in what would become their permanent home.\n\nComing in from the east in the late 1st century BI — in order to escape thralldom under a now long-dead empire, if tales are to be believed — they would encounter the Gallicader, the native inhabitants of the region, with whom they'd wage brutal warfare for decades to come. Eventually, this would end in the Gallicader largely exiting the stage of major historical importance, the codification of the [lifepath|E] system, and the founding of the first ostensible 'High Kingdom' (though its form would bear little resemblance to its contemporary counterpart). They were led by 'Good King' Bastione, who embodied what would today be considered an ideal monarch in Chevalien eyes - if in fact he had actually existed, which is a matter of some historical dispute.\n\nFrom the outset, despite their victory over the former denizens of [chevalie|E], they would be given little respite in peace, for conflict with the Oejeynicans of the north (which they had themselves provoked, in large part), the Kathanouxaic Empire of the south, and ultimately, the [liches|E], would all come to be existential threats. It was the defeat of the first [arch_lich|E], [vilas_venslau|E], that would mark the end of the Migratory Era in most conventional historians' eyes."
