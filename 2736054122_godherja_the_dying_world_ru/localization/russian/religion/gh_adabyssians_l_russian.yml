 adabyssian_religion_desc:0 "Dgudi, or "vessel-prayer," is the Abadyssian world for reverence toward the beautiful gilded sculptures that inhabit a place simply called the City of Golden Statues. When their forefathers first came to the city, they saw the wonderful, gleaming works towering far over their head, and asked themselves: how could these be anything but vessels of gods? These were not the traditional nature spirits they worshiped, but Great Spirits, those more worthy of respect than any other. It was the Great Spirits who created the world, and it was the Great Spirits who charged the Abadyssians with controlling it."

 adabyssian_desc:0 "In the Abadyssian faith, only the most purified—anointed rulers and pure-hearted clergy—are permitted to see the entirety of the golden statues with their own eyes. It is the priests who go into trances in the temples' cells, listening for commands from the gods emanating from the statues and relaying it into intelligible orders for mortals. And above all has been one command, repeated by the gods throughout the centuries: go forth and conquer, so that all the world may join them in supplication."
