 gedeora.0010.title:0 "Fell Winds Rise"
 gedeora.0010.desc:0 "Something about today is different. An unspoken ominousness hangs heavy in the air, and I'm not the only one to take note of it - hushed, but clearly hateful whispers fill the court, and the eyes of many of my servants shoot me looks of pure malice.\n\nI feel almost as if in a trance. Truths that I'd tried to ignore about the world now swirl around my mind and plague me. Will I take them to heart, though, or continue to wallow in childish naivete?"
 gedeora.0010.desc.depravity:0 "It’s nearly midday when I notice it: The feeling, pulsing in my chest, pure desire running through my veins. The entire world shifts and seems to recrystalize before my eyes. All these inhibitions, all these fears of rejection, of overexertion, of overdoing things…\n\nWhy, they were meaningless! Complete drivel spat out by judgemental cowards claiming to speak for [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. What right did they have to shackle us like this! From now on I shall live each moment to its fullest, denying myself nothing. From the looks my courtiers and servants are sharing amongst themselves I can see they share the same unspoken understanding. I have a feeling this is just the beginning of something magnificent!"
 gedeora.0010.desc.zeal:0 "I awake covered in sweat in the dead of night. Wan moonlight dances through my curtains onto the floor, illuminating my chambers. As I survey the space around me, I realize that every object in my room now seems to bear some kind of hidden meaning, as if they were placed deliberately by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to convey some kind of prophetic message. With the clarity of revelation I can see the invisible hand of the divine in my life, guiding me, preparing me for this moment. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] has chosen me to bear their message, they commune with me personally!\n\nI roll out of bed and rush feverishly to the window. In the pale light of Aervalr I can see a commotion beginning in the courtyard, courtiers stumbling out in their smallclothes and prostrating themselves in prayer, or ranting and preaching to one another. Some few shy back indoors, looking frightened and confused."
 gedeora.0010.desc.bloodlust:0 "I am holding court, trying not to fall asleep while listening to some dispute between insignificant landowners when it happens. The iron smell of blood suddenly fills the air, and my eyes water from the overpowering scent. My heartbeat quickens - how have I never noticed how enticing that scent truly is? Food and wine pales in comparison to its subtle flavors.\n\nThe argument happening in front of me turns from an amicable discussion on law minutiae over grazing rights into a screaming match in seconds. One of the men grips his cane in both hands as if he means to cave in his opponent’s skull with its brass head. I salivate at the thought, then begin to grow enraged myself at his cowardice. Why isn’t he acting? If he’s too much a coward to do it himself why shouldn’t I take care of both of them and save us all the trouble?"
 gedeora.0010.desc.ambition:0 "I am sharing an evening meal with some courtiers when it comes upon us. The light seems to dim noticeably for a moment, causing curious glances and a few seconds of panic before things return to normal. Perplexed looks are shared all around before we cautiously resume our meal.\n\nAs we do so, my mind suddenly begins racing. These men and women around me, can they be trusted? If I were them this would be the perfect time to poison my liege, or conspire to have [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] violently murdered in a private location with [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] guard down. And if I would do that, what's stopping them? Oh [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], I don’t even have my sword on me! I stand suddenly, spitting out my food in a panic. Others around the table are now doing the same, casting panicked glances at everyone around them."
 gedeora.0010.desc.apostasy:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] is dead.\n\nFrom the moment I rise from my bed, I cannot shake this thought. Every color seems more drab, every pleasure more meaningless, every flaw and crack in Aeras nakedly visible like never before. How could a world so fundamentally broken have ever been made by anything even approaching a perfect being?\n\nI go to the temple, intent on rekindling the flame within that once carried me through trial and tribulation, but I nearly weep when I arrive. It lies deserted, the priests apparently having had a similar change of heart. On the altar, a defaced idol of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] stands, stripped of all the gold and jewels that once made it shine. And underneath stands nothing but the truth - the fineries were merely dressing on a lie. We were all deceived, taken in by comforting promises and shallow truths, like children enthralled by a fairytale."

 gedeora.0010.a:0 "Aeras is a cold, cruel place."
 gedeora.0010.b:0 "No! I must snap out of this!"
 gedeora.0010.a.depravity:0 "[ROOT.Char.Custom('AttractionWomanManMultiple')|U], food, wine, I shall have it all!"
 gedeora.0010.b.depravity:0 "No, I cannot..."
 gedeora.0010.a.zeal:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] speaks through me!"
 gedeora.0010.b.zeal:0 "What is this fantasy, this madness? [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] protect me this is a delusion!"
 gedeora.0010.a.bloodlust:0 "I have my attendants fetch my sword, it’s time for some amusement."
 gedeora.0010.b.bloodlust:0 "Why, this is violence! Guards, intervene and stop this!"
 gedeora.0010.a.ambition:0 "I was a fool to trust anyone! Guards, form an escort and get me out of here!"
 gedeora.0010.b.ambition:0 "No, these are my friends, these thoughts are madness!"

 gedeora.0020.title:0 "Cursed Blood"
 gedeora.0020.desc:0 "Each day I grow, I find the world a more and more disappointing place. My old toys and friends seem so ridiculous and stupid in retrospect. The adults in my life; their stories and the morals that they tried to instill in me - all have proven nothing but lies and garbage.\n\nAnd I know what others think of me. The servants avoid me, and other kids say I am cursed. Why should I care for them? Day by day, they prove they are all nothing but worthless scum."
 gedeora.0020.a:0 "...and one day, they shall all rue it!"
 gedeora.0020.b:0 "But I am not cursed!"

 gedeora_struck_tt:0 "A [gedeora|E] has struck your capital county!"
 gedeora_in_target_populace_tt:0 "Since you are within the #E target populace#!, you will be affected by an additional effect!"
 gedeora_childhood_tt:0 "This has happened since you were affected by a [gedeora|E] while in the womb."
