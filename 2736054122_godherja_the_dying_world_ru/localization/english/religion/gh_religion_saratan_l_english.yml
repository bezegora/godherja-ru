 saratarat_religion_desc:0 "Saratarat is a pacifistic oceanic religion based around the worship of the saratans of the Kezymin crater. Sarataratians believe that the saratans were the first guardians of the world as well as the first beings to exist, and that their movements formed the seas and Aeras which swirled around them to form reality and the universe itself.\n\nWhile originally far more militaristic, the modern Saratarat faith split (the original incarnation now referred to as Saratadibe) after the devastating efects of [halakdun|E] which killed nearly half of all of the holy saratans along with much of the rest of [sarradon|E]. Between the death of so many saratans upon the backs of which most Saratarians live (and drowned with as they fell to the sea) and the deaths of thousands of Sarataratian faithful on those saratans that survived, the Sarataratian faithful entered a deep collective trauma.\n\nHaving since sworn off violencee except in the instance of defense of the saratans, the Sarataratians now live as peaceful traders, living generally humble lives as they fish the seas around the saratans and trade with mainlanders."

 saratadibe_desc:0 "Saratadibe is the original version of the faith now more often referred to as Saratarat. Still believing that the saratans formed the world from their slow movement through the seas, they also believed that saratans could only be born if one was to die. Thus, while the death of a saratan was a sad experience for all faithful, it was nevertheless natural and thus acceptable to slay the beast if necessary, though still controversial.\n\nBefore this belief was removed from the faith, those that lived upon the saratans would often engage in clan warfare and raids. This normally took the form of the saratan tribes loosing arrows at one another as two of them passed, and launching boats from the sides to board the other and loot their goods. With the death of half of all saratans and countless other faithful with [halakdun|E], the faithful entered a collective trauma, and the Saratadibe faith collapsed and formed a new pacifistic outlook."
