A mixture of beliefs and doctrines from both Aersodiaxianism and the Drakanorix Aagiokratia, the Cult of the Dragon focuses solely on the worship of those great beasts famed across Aeras for their might and majesty. They exhort the divine attributes of dragonkind, and insist that the creator god, Karalthor created those known as the Winged Lords in their own image to rule over mankind as benevolent monarchs and vicious scourges of injustice and impurity. The greatest of the Winged Lords, Paratharian stands above all others as the firstborn child of Karalthor and overlord of not only all dragons but of Aeras itself. A litany of other dragons make up the rest of the Cult's pantheon, though a great number of these ‘dragons' are in truth simply exceptionally potent magi deified after death."

 biblosxar_desc:0 "Confined to the isolated Western Isles, the cult of the Biblos'xarians and their hero Bibloseia is relatively unknown to the rest of Aversaria. In spite of this, Biblos'xarians are notoriously devoted to their deity, often conducting elaborate ceremonies and libations for the purpose of honoring him.\n\nFrom an early age, children are educated by their elders of Bibloseia's travels and struggles in his journey to obtain the ultimate gift: evading death itself. According to the legend passed down through generations, a young Bibloseia was spoken to one night by the spirit Sautono, promising him that immortality would be his if he killed the frightening death-king Polas-Uro in combat. Sautono warned the young boy that this was a task he would need to devote his life to, for entire armies had groveled at the feet of Polas-Uro before.\n\nBut Bibloseia was a determined soul. Through many years of training, he became an inspiring warrior, wielding a spear and a unique nine-sided shield he crafted from the finest wood and metal on his home island. Cutting down enemies like a lumberjack topples trees, Bibloseia eventually became strong enough to challenge Polas-Uro, who had kept his strength even in age. And after a duel lasting five hours, Polas-Uro was impaled through the head; the death-king was himself slain.\n\nYet when Bibloseia called upon Sautono to give him immortality, the spirit laughed. Without warning, Bibloseia was instantly turned into stone and cast deep into the earth. The devilish Sautono had given Bibloseia immortality, but not in the way that he wished..."

Praise be to Tagognth, God of the Bitter Wave!'\n\nThe cultists of the Bitter Wave are without exception regarded as an eerie people possessing utterly outlandish beliefs by their fellows. Given to the worship of the mysterious god Tagognth, whose true name is privy to none save only the most highly ranking of their priestly strata, the Cultists of the Bitter Wave practice a set of exceptionally unsettling rituals they believe are required to commune with the strange god of the sea. The blood of man is a common component, though other strange materials such as unusual skulls that resemble a sister group of humanity are also used from time to time. How or where they obtain such skulls and other strange curiosities is unknown. Priests and laymen both don helmets and armor of a make similar to no other culture on Aeras, confounding scholars who question the purpose of such attire. Adding to the mystifying nature of this cult are the frequent but oft dismissed reports by fishermen of the Isles that an immense being lurks beneath the sea, countless colorless eyes all pointed towards the surface. Watching… and waiting."

 seaborne_exalted_desc:0 "Hated by all, feared by many, scourges of the Shattered Coast and all its isles, the Seaborne Exalted are an abhorrent and spiteful cult who value the act of raiding and pillaging above all else. Believing that all of mankind arose from seasalt, to the Seaborne a life without murder, plunder, and rape is one devoid of any meaning. Life is short, and when one dies there is no lofty afterlife or place of heavenly residence but only the returning of one's body to the seasalt it was before.\n\nThus, one should seize any opportunities that might arise, commit any crimes one might wish to commit and take all that one can, for nothing lies beyond the veil of death besides an eternity of being carried from shore to shore by the perfidious sea that once troubled them so much in life. To kill is to exert one's will on this world of the damned and change the tides of fate themselves. To rule is to be strong, and the weak should stand aside or die when confronted by their betters. No law, no god, and no king constrains the Seaborne, who come where they will and go when they may, and woe betide any who seek to chain them."

 abathonic_cult_desc:0 "The legend of Abathon, ancient prophet, god-king and supposed creator of the isles is an enduring one, and worship of this primordial figure has been present in some form or another within the many islands of the northwest for millennia. Considered a strange and exotic cult by many, those who claim Abathon to be their god generally believe that the Magi ascended to godhood by his mysterious journey to each of the Wayline Isles, somehow having survived the typically immense amounts of overwhelmation resultant from such visits.\n\nOf more interest is their belief in the ritual of perpetuity which they say granted life unending. Though only fragments of this mythical spell have been discovered, those of the cult assert that it involved the sundering of the link between the soul and body of a child, creating an empty vessel that Abathon could then inhabit. While those genuinely believing in the fable are oft ridiculed for believing in something so obviously untrue, the attempts of several overly paranoid Aautokratirs to unearth the truth have universally ended in the disappearance of all expeditions sent to the accursed isles."

A faith sprung forth from the shores of the bay now named after Pathos, some Aversarian scholars assert that it may in fact be the furthest northern branch of Aversarian religions, though it is still distinct from the Aersodiaxianists of Aelarvisia and the Aagiokratians of the latter day empire. The self-proclaimed Listeners of Thoronis are of the belief that the eponymous god Thoronis gave rise to the oceans in an expression of their rage against the denizens of the seafloor who refused to offer worship to them. To avert such tragedies from occurring again, adherents regularly make offerings in the form of immense ships bearing sacrifices to the sea to appease the god, who will in return give gifts such as calm seas and bountiful harvests. It is rumored that these sacrificial vessels sometimes bear humans in times of famine and stormy weather, when their god is thought to be greatly angered, although the existence of such practices is vehemently denied by Thoronites."

 calystoanistism_desc:0 "Calystoanistism is a cult centered around the worship of the Agionist saint, Calysto, known to many as the greatest hero to ever spring forth from the rocky isles that dot the entire Shattered Coast. Originating from the few remnants of the legendary pirate's crew that managed to elude Aversarians and Order Militant both, the Calystoans held fast to the beliefs of their freedom-loving patron, treasuring personal autonomy and liberty above all else. For this they are staunchly opposed to the heretical Saintly Order of Calysto's Key, whom they view as mere slavers and heretics of the most vile breed. Unlike most cults of the isles centered around exceptional heroic figures, Calystoanistism holds Calysto to be a deity who descended from the celestial realm to unite the lost peoples of Aeras into one. Though he has now returned to his abode in the cosmos, it is believed that in this action he left the task of completing his holy work to humanity, a charge taken up by the Calystoans in their mission to break the bonds of servitude and bring about an era of complete freedom for all the people of Aeras."

 kidarian_dance_desc:0 "The Kidarian Dance, born in Sarradon, sees all of existence through the lens of rhythm and beats, where their gods are the dancers and the universe is their stage. Natural events, from light breezes to massive thunderstorms, are the gods' steps and moves, and the great cyclical patterns of nature are movements and tempos. Mortals are part of the dance too, though they do not understand the beats they follow in the way that the gods do.\n\nKidarian rituals unsurprisingly center around dancing. Whether to mimic a god's rhythm in thanks and praise, or to use their own rhythms in hope of influencing the world around them, Kidarian priests know a drumbeat for every prayer imaginable. They dedicate themselves in the name of Kidar-awah, the first man to learn the gods' rhythms, and strive to get a glimpse of the divine by dancing in the gods' steps in an endless frenzy. Unfortunately for them, it is more likely to result in bloodied feet and broken ankles than enlightenment."
