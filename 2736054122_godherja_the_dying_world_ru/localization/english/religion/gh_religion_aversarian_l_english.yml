Though their tenets may vary wildly, they all revolve around belief in the primordial "First Men," a divine race of [magic|E]-wielding humans led by a mage named the Purest. The [aversarians|E], who had the most [magical|E] ability, unsurprisingly considered themselves to be the greatest descendents of the First Men and the closest followers of the Purest's teachings. And if they are the closest to true humans, then foreigners and heathens are a bit less than human."

Even further, the Amaghean Aagiokratia holds that Magi can transcend to an even higher plane of existence than the other gods and be ever closer to Arnaz the "Great Ancestor" and rule eternally from heavenly paradise. Warriors are still more often exalted, though the faith emphasizes that this is through showing "aspects of Magi" and that they will rarely, if ever, be able to rise quite as high as those with the gift. This faith came about when Aversaria pacified the Amaghean coasts; however, it did not take major traction until the reign of Dedaphal Mariamne 'the Builder,' who would patronize the Amaghean Aagiokratia and turn it into its modern incarnation."

 aversarian_sunarwei_desc:0 "The Sunarwei Aagiokratia is perhaps one of the most peculiar results of the Aversarianization of a native faith to improve stability of [aversaria|E]'s vast empire. While normally Aversarianization of a faith involves modifying the faith to exalt the [aversarians|E] and [magi|E] in some form in order to quell dissent, the Sunarwei Aagiokratia instead attempts to encourage more militaristic outlooks and push back against its traditional pacifistic beliefs while making almost no mention of [aversarians|E] or [magi|E].\n\nWhile this seems contradictory to [aversarian|E] desires for control, study of the political situation in Aironoi when the [aversarians|E] began syncreticism efforts make it far more obvious the reasoning. While the [aversarians|E] had allied the Öltenic, there was great fear among the nobility of the possibility of betrayal or rogue actors, and that the Öltenic horsemen could then either threaten the land trade routes going south through Sunarwei lands or even overwhelm the south before [aversaria|E] could mobilize and cut the governate in half.\n\nTo this end, the [aversarians|E] have encouraged a belief that while all living beings are indeed glass shards of the god Kumhant, destroying shards simply creates more, and just as a dead animal gives life to the earth under it, destroying can simply be seen as creating more life. While of questionable consistency with the rest of Sunarwei dogma, worshippers of the Aversarianized faith historically filled most southern armies afterwards, and often served as mercenaries abroad."

 aversarian_aironoian_desc:0 "Owing to their great distance from the homeland, the [aversarian|E] priest in eastern Aironoi struggled to maintain any sort of orthodoxy among the faithful. While the [aversarian|E] Aagiokratia has always been far from consistent among its thousands of local and imperial cults, the mass deviation its easternmost practitioners slid into was cause for such concern that many priests worried they'd slide from the faith altogether. Despite best attempts, however, what would become known as the Aironoian Aagiokratia largely began to reach a level of consistency with its eastern cults instead of the homelands, and soon became a somewhat codified heresy deeply ingrained in eastern culture.\n\nBorn from the cosmopolitan trade cities dotting the eastern coast and rivers, the Aironoian Aagiokratia is a peculiar mixture of dozens of local religions, faiths and cults. The priests of this branch wear masks like those of the Öltenic as their physical form may only be seen by the Purest upon their death. A caste system based around which particular cult or profession one belongs to was inspired by the practices of the eastern Kashiryans along with hundreds of their infinite gods, leading to professions all worshipping separate patron deities (ostenibly different First Men). Perhaps most obvious of all, Cuthanagi river worship has slowly become a core tenet of the eastern cults, great processions of faithful parading every time their rivers flood and the faithful filling them with floating lanterns."

Considering themselves the watchers for the end times, their secretive meetings have gradually expanded the number of Heralds, having reached the number 8 when [frodbrokna|E] devastated the world. Seeing what was surely the beginning of the end, priests rushed to declare the last two Heralds, with Aeschraes and Axiotheia as the most common choices for the dubious honorific, though others have also become candidates, including the [fog|E], Aexionarax, Cenware, along with many more.\n\nThough it might normally be expected of such a faith to consolidate around a single message, the imminent apocalypse has rendered such quibbling worthless, and the worshipers of the Red Star are instead devoted to enjoying what little time they have left in the form of endless celebrations and orgies, taking what they still can of life before their long-dead master returns to avenge their ancient sin."

They believe that no man should take the life of a living thing, or use anything that was not freely offered to them from Aeras. Many of them interpret that tenet as a ban against wearing clothes made from cultivated textiles, animal hides, or metal armor, and are most identifiable by their ritual nudity.\n\nDespite their nonaggressive nature, they have earned plenty of ire from both the Agionists and the Aversarians. They are condemned as heretics and deviants of the lowest form, and they are frequently harassed and killed when making pilgrimages to places important in Katharitos' life. But that does not stop them from practicing their faith, nor does it deter new recruits."

Believed to have been one of the original faiths of the Aversarian peoples, perhaps even the first one. While this is not sure, what is known is that the oldest found piece of Aversarian writing, the Drakánoramonicar, was clearly created by faith leaders of the cult.\n\nDrakánorix Aagiokrata worships the dragons of ancient Aversaria, deifying them as pure beings created from purge magic and divinity, sent to the world by an unknown being to rule man. While extremely disconnected and spread across much of the world (cults being found as far as Sarradon), the faith nonetheless dominated much of what is now the Imperial Isle, Etepezea, and the Shattered Sea. It would remain a pillar of Aversarian society even after the formation of the Aversarinas Aautokrata, only falling to the wayside after the War of the Thousand Dragons. Ironically, they would serve the Imperial faction in the Civil War, their long-running hatred of Aersodiaxianism throwing them alongside the Aagiokrata. After their victory, Lethigianex would slaughter all remaining dragons, and those remaining cultists with them. The final high priest of the Dragon Cults would attempt a final uprising under Aautokratia Maklea, in the midst of her purges, and would be flayed and nailed to the wall of her palace with the desecrated horns of dragons."

 aversarian_zaragett_desc:0 "The isles of the southeast have been under the rule of Aversaria since before the Chaos of the Seventh Century and though considered to be irrelevant by many, the Aautokratir Varthanius endeavoured greatly to consolidate imperial control over the area in order to safeguard the passing between the fledgling province of Aironoi and Opakhasia. Part of his initiatives were the subduing of the Zaragett, masters of water magics who had lived in the area from time immemorial and had fiercely resisted the initial Aversarian conquest. The result was the Zaragett Aagiokratia, a faith that elevates the magi priesthood to a position of supreme power over both the temporal and spiritual worlds. Furthermore, designated god-kings were to serve as high priests, placing them above the rest of the priesthood and rule over the faithful as incarnates of the Seamother and Moonfather. Typically the reigning Aautokratir of Aversaria is held to be the god-king of the Zaragett, though in recent times a great many warlords have taken to making use of the title in the pursuit of ever greater power."

 aversarinas_practitioner_desc:0 "First appearing after the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E] with the rise of the [the_mayikprolollan|E], Practitioner Aagiokratia is a cult which believe that the [Aagiokrata|E] is flawed for allowing the profanity of naming non-[magi|E] as divine. Adherents often either lock themselves in their towers devoting their time to research, in pursuit of learning more about the intricacies of [magic|E] and perfecting their [magic|E], or work on turning [Aversaria|E] into the ideal magocracy. Though derided as ambitious pretenders with limited legitimate skills by some, declaring oneself for the cult is seen as a showing of strength among the powerful (and not so powerful) [magi|E] nobles."
