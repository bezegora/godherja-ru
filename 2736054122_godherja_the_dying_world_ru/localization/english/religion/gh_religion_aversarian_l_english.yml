 aversarinas_aautokrata_religion_desc:0 ""[aversarinas_aagiokratia|E]" is the catch-all term for the state religion of the [aversarian|E] Aautokrata and its assorted denominations, offshoots, and heresies. Though their tenets may vary wildly, they all revolve around belief in the primordial "First Men," a divine race of [magic|E]-wielding humans led by a mage named the Purest. the Aversarians, who had the most [magical|E] ability, unsurprisingly considered themselves to be the greatest descendents of the First Men and the closest followers of the Purest's teachings. And if they are the closest to true humans, then foreigners and heathens are a bit less than human."

 aversarinas_aautokrata_desc:0 "[aversarinas_aagiokratia|E], or "Imperial Humanity," is the term used to summarize what was once the official faith of the Empire. Its centers of power fractured by the [frodbrokna|E], and its believers are threatened by bloodthirsty heathens spilling over its borders. the faith is under great strain, and disconcerting numbers of its followers have turned away from orthodoxy in hopes of seeking answers."

 aversarian_megistos_desc:0 "Propagated by Megistos "the Mad Emperor," this faith is dismissed as a mockery of virtue by those who adhere to traditional Aversarian ways. To adherents, the descendents of the Purest are mentally and physically sound enough to indulge in physical sensations without fear of corruption. But to outsiders, it seems like the ravings of a delusional nymphomaniac who says his gods want him to host orgies and bed every beautiful woman in his court."

They have proclaimed him to be the physical reincarnation of the Purest, who has returned to the world in order to right what was wronged and restore His empire to its former glory. They are willing to do anything, especially if it includes honorable death in battle, in order to fulfill their divine leader's mission of reuniting the Aagiokratia.\n\nIt is unclear whether or not Nicanoneus himself believed his followers' claims of his divinity, but there are few reasons he would object. After all, it flooded his ranks with rabidly devoted holy warriors willing to obey his every word."

 aversarinas_aautokrata_reformed_desc:0 "The old ways of the Aversarians died the same way they were practiced and enforced, at the tip of a sword. In the chaos following the collapse of the Aversarinas Aautokrata, Legan Hecaeda of the LXI Legion swore to prevent the circumstances that led to its destruction from ever happening again. To be an Aversarian is no longer defined by bloodlines and ancestry, but through personal virtue, and the noble magocracy of old has been torn down and replaced with a meritocracy."

They have adapted their rituals to be performed facing the shore, and their priests try and divine the future by observing the patterns of clouds and waves during storms. They insist that they are still just as faithful as any other Aagiokratian, but suddenly clam up when asked by an outsider to explain the details of their faith."

They rallied behind one of their own and proclaimed him the Ypsilantis Omitilos, demanding that every other ecclesiastical and secular ruler show deference. They want a strong head around whom the faithful can rally... and weak kings who are incapable of getting in their way."

Purity is not earned by the blood in one's veins, but how much heathen blood one spills. And Gorassos intended for #EMP much#! blood to be spilled in his name."

They also claim—and not without merit—that the Imperial succession was legally his by right, and that all who consider themselves descendents of the Purest must acknowledge his claim."

Admiring their new masters' strength, the Kikarsagi largely abandoned their Öltenic religion and adopted the faith that conquered them.
