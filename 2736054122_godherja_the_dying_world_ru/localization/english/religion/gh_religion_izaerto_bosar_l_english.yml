However, the deity known as the 'Feathered One' is also believed to give the world its colour and grant mortals a reprieve in an eternal paradise to outlast Aeras. Adherants usually do not believe in the intervention of gods in the mortal sphere, but they do not doubt that the Feathered One watches over them."

 izaerto_bosar_adherent:0 "Izáerto Bošárian"
 izaerto_bosar_adherent_plural:0 "Izáerto Bošárians"
 izaerto_bosar_desc:0 "Izáerto Bošár, meaning 'Thousand Masters' is a faith centered around the belief that eons ago a thousand shadow-skinned god-kings were sent down from the uncaring and eldritch chief god named the 'Great Void'. The Thousand Masters had the power to manipulate stars and would turn whatever living creature they touched into horrible abominations, their human slaves who toiled to create great dark shrines to them included. Humanity, as the Izáerto Bošárians tell, rose up and struck down the Thousand Masters in a horribly brutal rebellion, during which almost all of humanity died. As the Great Void turned its abyssal gaze to watch the destruction, humanity too struck the eldritch being in the mystical infinite plane from which it resided with an attack of the Thousand Master's own creation. Because of this, they claim the world is now doomed, for while darkness is banished, without darkness there can never truly be light and that all history thereafter is thus nothing besides the last pretenses of a dying world.\n\nFinally, they also believe that the counterpoint to the Great Void is a minor deity named the 'Feathered One', a giant mystical bird with rainbow feathers from which all light reflects and gives the world color. The Feathered One swallows the souls of all dying people and lets them enter the eternal paradise within them to live in peace forever while the mortal realm dies. Most foreign observers agree their faith is ridiculous, and the often agnostic faithful normally say that the stories are mostly metaphorical but the Feathered One is truly real."

Instead, they believe that the flesh of the dead must be eaten first so that the soul can drift into Paradise and the embrace of Chitdada. They have traditionally been a small and aggresive sect, and often treat their more mainstream kin as apostates that have chosen to forget the truth."

These secretive groups praise the Hidden Master instead of hating him, for it was he that taught them to hide their faith and scheme in the shadows. Unrelenting and untrustworthy, the Hurimaki have made few friends over the course of their existence."
