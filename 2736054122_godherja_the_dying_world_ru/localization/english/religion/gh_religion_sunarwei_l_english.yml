 sunarwei_religion_desc:0 "An odd faith originating in southern Aironoi, the Sunarwei perplex their neighbors with their strange beliefs. Whereas other peoples may say there are ten, a hundred, one or even no gods, the Sunarwei say the entire world is god. Every man and woman, every blade of grass and tree, every beast of the land, bird of the air, and creature of the sea - all share in being a part of the Creator God. The humble teach that this state of affairs came out when the creator quarreled with the sun, a conflict which ended with the Maker of the World transmuting themself into glass, and being shattered into numberless shards, each becoming a different facet of the World That Is. Even stranger, the Sunarwei don't view the sun as evil for this act of generative deicide - instead claiming that their all knowing god's death was a deliberate and premeditated act of love for all the life that the Creator knew would spring forth from their own body."

 sunarwei_desc:0 "The Sunarwei faith (meaning God-Worship in its practitioners' ancient languages), is a relatively insular belief system that has primarily centered around the rocky coast of southern Aironoi and the shepherd and fishing communities commonly found there. The Sunarweiia believe that the creator god Kumhant attempted to journey to [aeras|E] which they created from the heavens, but in doing so they passed too close to the sun, and turned to glass. As they entered the world, they shattered, and the trillions of shards of glass became all living and non-living things, from humanity to animals to plants and even all the other stars in the sky.\n\nSunarweiia believers often preach acceptance, kindness, and pacifism to match their live-and-let-live philosophy. If all things are remnants of the same great god, then they are all equal, and deserving of respect."
