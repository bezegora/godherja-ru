 xaxbaxakanax_desc:0 "Despite many foreigners finding the Xax'baxa'kanax name and (extremely few) theological texts to be so incomprehensible to assume the religion is esoteric, it is in fact an exceptionally simple set of beliefs when compared to many contemporaries. This is, believed by the [aversarians|E] at least to be most likely caused by them having been exceptionally primitive and disparate when their few historical realms were consumed by their neighbors.\n\nTo the Xax'baxa'kanaxians who traditionally made their living through shepherding, the world is merely a small piece in a greater reality made up of other worlds (the flock) which are pushed along their proper path by the great Shepherd. The Shepherd himself is also believed to be on his own world, living a life as a common man, his world too being guided, along with unknowable worlds above him and perhaps even more below the humble Xax'baxa'kanaxians.\n\nThe Xax'baxa'kanaxi faith most commonly preaches acceptance with the world and all of its events, for good or for worse. All worlds are guided by a shepherd, and just as the Xax'baxa'kanaxians sheep may get skittish as they are brought to their pens, so too is any worry about the world simply latent nervousness born from ignorance of the Shepherd's plan.\n\nThe few Xax'baxa'kanaxian realms in history have often been led by petty despots claiming that their opression was simply meant to be, and likewise the rebels who overthrow them then claiming that so too was their destruction. The priestly caste however has never maintained any form of power over the faithful, their role being little more than ceremony keepers and funeral speakers, the Xax'baxa'kanaxians believing they hold no true spiritual power. When their homelands were conquered by the [aversarians|E], they saw it as just yet another in a series of petty despots that would always come and always go, and the faithful largely avoided harsh treatment by being too minor to achieve notice."
