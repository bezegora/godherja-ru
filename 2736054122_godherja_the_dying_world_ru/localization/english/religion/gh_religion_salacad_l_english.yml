 segyetes_desc:0 "The Segyetes faith believe that Mother Sky and Father Earth were once lovers who created the sky and earth together as one. However, Father Earth grew jealous of Mother Sky’s beautiful creation, humanity. He wanted to bring his own beings into existence to compete with hers, so he formed demons out of the dirt. The demons terrorized the world, leading Mother Sky to wage war on her lover’s creations. The ensuing battles led to Mother Sky tearfully plunging her spear into Father Earth, splitting the earth and sky asunder and separating humanity from their creator. The Segyetes believe that the way to salvation is to reconcile their relationship so that the two can finally be whole again. Both men and women serve as shamans communing with the sky and earth to mend the bonds that were broken."
