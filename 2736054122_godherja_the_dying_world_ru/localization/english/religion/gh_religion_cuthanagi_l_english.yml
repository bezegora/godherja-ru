 cuthanagi_desc:0 "The Cuthanagii are a faith centered around the worship of the Kasiryat River, which they believe is a mortal mirror to a similar river that runs through the realm of the gods. To the Cuthanagii, the gods are unknowable, without names or forms or anything that mankind could possibly comprehend. Instead, these gods interact with the world purely through the great Kasiryat, and nothing else.\n\nCuthanagii priests generally live in a cycle of doomsaying and celebration depending on the state of the river, claiming the joy and happiness of the gods when the Kasiryat floods and leaves behind great fertility for the faithful, and coming apocalypse when stricken with drought. Most notably, this is reflected by great celebrations during floodtimes with thousands of paper candles being sent drifting down the river by jubilant faithful."
