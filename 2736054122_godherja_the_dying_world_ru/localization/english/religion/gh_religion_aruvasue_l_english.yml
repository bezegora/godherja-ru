 aruvasue_adj:0 "Aruvasuen"
 aruvasue_adherent:0 "Aruvasuen"
 aruvasue_adherent_plural:0 "Aruvasueni"
 aruvasue_desc:0 "Aruvasueni believe that the world was born when Aruvas, He-Who-Is-One-But-Is-Three, became disunited under the strain of His own power. Aruva Tsere became the sun, Aruva Nilud the moon, and Aruva Agat became the spirit of humankind. adherents to the teachings of His prophets believe that the feast is the most sacred of things, and that an honoured guest is inhabited by the spirit of Aruva Agat who will speak on their behalf in the Os Kinjer, the Last Test that determines whether they shall meet Aruva Tsere in paradise or be damned to toil in the eternal prison of Aruva Nilud. Those who pass the Last Test in life are made into saints, and their statues stand proudly amongst the angels that serve the three realms of the Moon-Sun-King in their temples.\n\nAn arrogant people unaware of their own contradictions, the Aruvasueni have rarely held any great kingdom in Aironoi for longer than a decade, too consumed by their own pageantry and piety to make skilled warriors or wise scholars. The Aruvasuen mindset, however, has endured through both prosperity and poverty, and the arrogance shown by priest and pauper alike is not easily matched."

 rutbay:0 "Rut'Bay"
 rutbay_adj:0 "Rut'Bayan"
 rutbay_adherent:0 "Rut'Bayan"
 rutbay_adherent_plural:0 "Rut'Bayani"
 rutbay_desc:0 "Rut'Bay, or the 'Twelve Brothers', is the code of the twelve dissenters who killed the first 'saint' to succeed in the Os Kinjer whilst living. It is their belief that the Os Kinjer cannot be understood by living priests, and that the spirit of Aruva Agat is found in the feast itself, not any guest. They are also some of the few faithful to openly shun magic, seeing it as a gift stolen from the Moon-Sun-King. \n\nWhilst initally a large movement, a lack of support amongst the richest Aruvasueni towns meant that the faith was suppressed quickly. The Rut'Bayan creed states that one day, when the world needs them most, the twelve dissenters will return from Paradise and save the faithful from their sins. The faith has often been mocked by foreign powers, but its influence over the early religon cannot be overstated."

 sarmuyr_desc:0 "The Sar'muyr are the children of the Sword Mother, the angelic right hand of Aruva Nilud. It is said that she is the one who is encounters when Os Kinjer is failed, taking the fallen faithful to the realm of her lunar master. Across all Aruvasuen faiths, the Sword Mother is revered for her strength and wisdom, but the Sar'muyr hold her in especially high regard. \n\nThe Sar'muyr believe that the Sword Mother is Queen of the Dead as Aruva Agat is King of the Living, and that they must devote their mortal lives to killing those that would dare deny her. They refuse to enact Os Kinjer until they can meet their mother, and are deeply protective of their ability to trace their bloodlines to the orignal Sar'muyr."

 blorivok_desc:0 "The Blorivok are a moderate reaction to a sea of hostile faiths around them. adherents believe that Aruvas desires the unity of humankind above all, and that mortal distractions such as war are trivial in comparison to eternal salvation. Even though they later developed into a genuine religious movement, the origins of the Blorivoken faith were purely pragmatic, and a means to stop the perceived harm Ertomaxism had done to Aruvasue."

 ertomax_desc:0 "Ertomaxism, named for the fourth king to unite the feuding Aruvasuen peoples, is founded upon the idea that the spirit of the Moon-Sun-King exists only in the souls of the faithful. Ertomax, as the king, believed himself to be the most faithful of all. His followers would slaughter those who denied He-Who-Is-One-But-Is-Three in great celebrations in honour of Ertomax, and in return he would bestow them with the right to feast with him and enact Os Kinjer.\n\nThe death of Ertomax at the hands of a nameless assasin did not kill the flames of fervour amongst his supporters. Ertomaxism has remained a powerful force within Aruvasue, and his supporters continue to await the day that he will return to resume the purification of the world. Many have been claimed to be the beloved Ertomax, but few have survived long enough to fulfil his legacy."
