The land itself however, had been reduced to ash, scorched by its creators. Instead of freedom, humanity found themselves trapped in cycles of disease, death and grief, alien concepts to their subterranean lives. From that day on, Orgarrdians have sought to find the rock-hewn paradise they were birthed from, constructing underground temples and mining deeper into sacred stone so that the sinful surface does not corrupt their soul.""
