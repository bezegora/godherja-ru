 ritualist_religion_desc:0 "Less of a defined faith and more a label for a collection of local beliefs, Ritualism is a polytheistic group of faiths native to [sarradon|E] that tend to have esoteric beliefs and secretive ceremonies. Common among these sects is their reverence for the Thousand-and-One Steps of Sophocos, a [tower|E] where one can achieve enlightenment if they climb every man-sized step and face a plethora of trials from the gods. The few who achieved this task had their accounts compiled in the Story of the Steps, an esoteric tome which is consulted for guidance and whose meanings are hotly debated among its followers. To walk the Thousand-and-One steps is not only a literal pilgrimage for Ritualists, but also a figurative quest for self-improvement."

Over time they began to degenerate in size and wisdom, and their philosophy likewise degenerated into what is now called [magic|E], becoming dangerous and enticing men to evil. A few called the Banu Daniyal fled underground to the True Sophocos, while their kinsmen transformed into modern man.

Though it was not originally meant to be a permanent sect, Zatanai incorporated elements of the Suleimani’a sect into his own, chiefly the belief in Domah Daniyal and the view that all philosophies can be learned from, though Zatanai rejected the idea that non-Ritualist philosophies have any merit. Zatanai and his followers believe that Ritualism is the one and only way of life for mankind; all other religions are mere perversions of Ritualism, and so must either be assimilated if possible or destroyed if not. Zatanai was one of the youngest Ritualist prophets in the religion’s history, and he entered into occultation at nineteen years of age after declaring that he would return when his people needed him most."

Sarah was accompanied by a band of other Ritualists who reported seeing the angels as well. Speaking to their prophetess, the angels commended the Ritualists for their devotion to Sophocos, and gave Sarah a revelation: the gods and goddesses of this world were but masks worn by the angels of Sophocos, and each religion was but another path to enlightenment. She was therefore charged with delivering peace to men, to cease the endless wars of Sarradon and bring an understanding between Ritualist and Wardenite, and then to spread this message of peace to the world entire. She and her new converts called themselves the Tribe of the Angels, and set about spreading this message of coexistence."

The concept of priest-king, high priest, or god-king is an abomination to the Karimii, who argue that any sort of organized priesthood merely serves to repress the truths delivered on Sophocos’ steps. The priesthood should therefore be comprised entirely of the laity, and any attempt to impose organization on it or to codify the religion should be violently resisted. Ascension of Sophocos is considered paramount for any true Karimi’a, and every member of the sect and prospective priest is expected to make the journey at least once in their lifetimes."

He then created animals by burning himself, and he created the race of men by tearing out his own heart. Finally, he used his spine to erect Sophocos and the Spires of Woe. Having invested so much of himself into the world, he gave the first men a simple commandment: go forth and slaughter. As more people are slain and suffer, the Pain God will regenerate his body. The legends of the Slaves have it that Ashred was worshiped long ago by an empire of mighty warriors, but their empire crumbled and, bereft of regular sacrifices, Ashred punished man severely. To prevent further punishments, the Slaves must suffer so that others do not."

 eirbaadit_al_hukadir_desc:0 "Hukadirites believe that the world came into being from the swirling maelstrom of Fawhadaa, uncreated by any intelligent being. There all manner of beasts emerged, and prime among them was mankind. But men were without gods, and so they were without morality; they set about to create their own gods, and their own morality, but were unsuccessful. Thither came Qubaal, the First Vampire, who successfully made himself a god. Qubaal then instructed others on how to achieve divinity, and the first vampires ruled over a magnificent empire called Sophocos, from which Qubaal ruled at his great spire. Eirbaadit al-Hukadir operates under a euhemeristic framework, assuming that all gods have a mortal origin; they are either non-existant or were otherwise mortals who became deified. While the former is less valid than the latter, what ultimately matters is whether someone pays the Blood Tithe or not."

They have trapped themselves in this false reality through the deceits of al-Khadidruj, but may learn the truth through Sophocos - which itself does not exist - and regain control of their spiritual bodies and break the delusion of existence."

Attaining an understanding of Wardenite beliefs, and sympathizing with the Wardenite cause, Hanaa was said to have been given a revelation when she ascended the steps of Sophocos, warning her that the physical world was created by a malevolent demiurge, and that it this demiurge’s servants must be combated whenever possible. Only through its annihilation can mortals be freed from the shackles of physical existence and dwell eternally in the Gardens of Life. Hanaa also preached that there was but one god, and that this god was named the One. The One commanded the Ritualists to battle the demiurge long ago, but these prophets were misinterpreted or slain by their followers; therefore, the One gave a revelation unto the first of the Wardenites, and abandoned the Ritualists. But if the Ritualists heed Hanaa, and live according to the Road of the One - a list of laws delivered to Hanaa - the One will favor them again."

Supposedly, mastery of this song will grant one enlightenment and great magical skill, with the Xwestrozên believing that [magi|E] draw their power from knowledge of some notes of the song. However, all music is considered holy to the Xwestrozên, not just the Song of Sophocos, and musicians are widely regarded as pious individuals."
