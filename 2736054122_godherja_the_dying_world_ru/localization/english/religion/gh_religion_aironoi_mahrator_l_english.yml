 mahrator_religion_desc:0 "The Mahrator religion is descended from Töragei Khatan and his clan, himself being a son of the great warlord Otached's concubine, Urgu. Seeking glory greater than that which he gained in the [bayyuralar|E], he led some of the clans north into Amaghea during the [aironoian_migration|E], carving out his own realm there. It has since evolved into a religion almost unrecognizable from its Öltenic forebears, worshiping the God of Men, Kaigan, as Kaegan, God of Horses and King of Heaven."

 mahrator_desc:0 "The Mahrator religion is mostly animistic, worshiping a large host of horse-spirits hailed as being almost equivalent to the gods. Kaegan, God of Horses and King of Heaven, is said to have taught the first men how to ride horses with the aid of Horsemother, who once rode across the sky until the horse-hating goddess Ur-mai threw her down to the earth\n\nHorses are revered as being quasidivine, and are given lavish funerals upon death. To harm a horse is a grievous sin punishable by death. The Mahratorans also believe that a man's worth is proven only through combat, and so they conduct ritual raids against their enemies. Both horses and men are given sky burials so that Ur-mai cannot steal their souls."
