 vidvaookeyatra_desc:0 "Vidvaookeyatra, or 'Scholar's Journey' in ancient Kashiryan is the belief and worship of the hermaphroditic god of knowledge Sarvat (often referred to as the Divine Librarian), the religion itself the result of Otached's [otachedian_empire|E]'s encouragement of cult offshoots from the ancient Avastya Mahani faith. While still technically believing in most gods from the Avastya Mahani pantheon, their roles in the faith have been greatly downplayed, the Vidvaookeyatrans instead emphasizing Sarvat as the font of all knowledge and thus the knowledge of creation itself.\n\nWhile the Vidvaookeyatra are to thank for great technological, societal and historical progress, the [Concept('vidvaookeyatran_scholarly_caste','scholarly caste which leads the faith')|E] is generally blamed for numerous calamaties (most notably the [chan_skorpokaipis|E]), though Vidvaookeyatran scholars are still at best... divided over the matter of them accepting any amount of blame."

 askevaryaa_desc:0 "Askevaryaa, from the Kashiryan word 'rejection', was formed after the apocalyptic events of the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] and the [dharya_varha|E] anti-scholarly rebellions especially.\n\nAfter Vidvaookeyatran scholars nearly destroyed  Kashirya four (relatively major) times in only two centuries through their incompetence, with countless other close-calls only narrowly prevented from becoming equally as devasating, the Dharyaam Lon ('Righteous Ones') rose up in mass rebellion among the common castes and attempted to overthrow the scholarly order. Their blame towards the nobility for patronizing the scholars for so long caused the rebel mobs to also target the ruling class, which resulted in the aristocracy of Kashirya siding against the rebels and joining the Vidvaookeyatrans to battle them.\n\nAfter destroying countless libraries and academies, as well as assassinating many scholars, the rebellion was crushed after fifty years of conflict. The survivors retreated to remote communes and hideaways and slowly formed the Askevaryaa faith.\n\nDue to its origins in Vidvaookeyatran dominated Kashirya, the Askevaryaa faith shares nearly all of the same gods and tenets and even still holds up Sarvat as the chief god in their diverse pantheon. However, where they diverge is the Askevaryaan insistence of 'Evil Lore', knowledge that entered the world against Sarvat's wishes thanks to the efforts of evil demons and gods. Evil Lore is to be destroyed and wiped out, along with those who know of it, in order to please Sarvat's wishes and ensure that the world is as they wished. This has naturally led to Askevaryaans regularly burning down libraries across Kashirya in an attempt toerase remnants of ancient and dark rituals."

Nabbarekians maintains that the 4th century guru Pethyka discovered and read each book and ascended after his martyrdom by supersticious warlords who killed Pethyka and burned his books.\n\nNabbarekian worship revolves around studying the life of Pethyka, fervently reading and memorizing what they claim are the remaining or recovered remnants of the ninety-one books, and attempting to discover and recreate the knowledge through research and archeological effort.\n\nAfter the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] and [dharya_varha|E], the Nabbarekians were greatly influenced by Askevaryaan thought. Since then, they have added that the ninety-one books are holy, but all other knowledge is the creation of man or a bastardization of the great works, and thus no other knowledge is truly sacred."

Effectively abandoning Sarvat as a deity, along with the entirety of the old Avastya Mahani pantheon for that matter, Aandaronshiaks believe the gods are an utterly unknowable force that are manifested in humanity as [magic|E].\n\nMeaning 'inner strength' in Kashiryan, Andaronshiaki believe that through the perfection of virtues that one can gain the power of their esoteric 'gods' in the form of the control of magic. If one does not possess the ability but still lives a virtuous life, then they are reincarnated in the next as a Magi in rewarded in that one.\n\nThe other most notable trait of the Andaronshiaki are their bitter hatred for the concept of religious formalism, believing that the path to magic is intensely personal and any attempt to structure this path or codify it is antithetical to the holy goals."

Varodaists believe that the creation of the world was done through the shifting of water that slowly carved land from rock, and that the holy oceans and seas can portray prophecies within the movement of their waves.\n\nVarodaists also worship Varoda's children, the aquatic creatures of the sea which they maintain all land creatures descended from, ancient beasts slowly walking on land and shedding their scales. Varodaists see time as cyclical, believing that the world is in an unending series of being consumed by the sea and destroyed, only for the seas to recede and for the sea creatures to once again wander onto land to repopulate the reformed land.\n\nPerhaps most known for their ability to tame nautical beasts. The most famous Varodaist figure, the prophet Mogurpa, is said to have gone so far as to have tamed and rode a kraken for most of his life."

 dravadari_adherent_plural:0 "Avastya Mahani"
 dravadari_desc:0 "One of [aeras|E]'s oldest faiths and most likely the oldest organized religion in Kashirya, the Avastya Mahani faith is a polytheistic faith that, at least two thousand years before the formation of [aversaria|E], either migrated west from the lands of Dahangon or was inspired by pagan migrants entering Kashirya from the region. Avastya Mahani believe in an infinite number of equal gods, with thousands or more of them being formally recorded and accepted at some point of the faiths history. To the Avastya Mahani, gods are ephemeral creators who can die, live or be reborn just as humans can, and the universal constant of negentropy and entropy effects the gods just as it does humans.\n\nWhile most Avastya Mahani choose one to a handful of gods to focus their worship upon, many cults to specific deities have split from the faith and formed their own religions (especially after Kashirya's conquest by Otached's [iorne_horde|E]) such as Saravarawat, god of knowledge whose followers formed Vidvaookeyatranism; and Karhikala, god of war, death and justice whose followers would form Karitkamaicism. Often forgotten is Paerasjatan, god of creation magic who is often said to have been the one to make the first iteration of the world.\n\nThe oldest myths of the Avastya Mahani, though belief in them is extremely rare, claims that the infinite gods are reflections of Paerasjatan who forged all of them. The uplifting of specific gods to lead over the pantheon by its child faiths, however, has largely led to Parasjatan's erasure."

Karitkarmaicists believe in the necessity of war, death and peace, all parts of an endless cycle upon which society and the world will always turn.\n\nWhile Karitkarmaicists do not believe that war and death should be sought, it also shouldn't be rejected, and instead should be embraced as part of the universal experience. As a result, Karitkarmaicist realms are generally peaceful and insular, though often ritually maintain great defenses in preparation for the inevitability of conflict.\n\nWhile historically equally as powerful as the dominant Vidvaookeyatranianism, [murtuy_ka_varha|E] led to the Karitkarmaicist heartlands being widely depopulated and then conquered by contemporaneous faiths, ending the faiths period of success."

 daramarjaratan_desc:0 "One of many Avastya Mahani offshoots, Daramarjaratanists worship Daramarjaratan (originally Damaratjarat) as the ruler of all gods. However, Daramarjaratan is the goddess of death and wife of the god Karitkarmaic, and her faithful would forge perhaps the most controversial of the Avastya Mahani child-faiths.\n\nNot only believing that Damaratjarat is above her fellow gods, they have gone so far as to state that not only does Damaratjarat rule the underworld of human souls waiting for reincarnation or unable to do so, but she also rules over an underworld of the gods. In fact, Daramarjaratanists claim that the entire infinite pantheon of gods have long died, and that they remain trapped in the divine underworld and can only let their will be known through Daramarjaratan, interpreter of the dead.\n\nDespite their beliefs being the cause of numerous conflicts with its sister faiths, almost all of them were defensive in nature, Daramarjaratan worship generally being exceptionally insular and focused more on the affairs of the dead than the living. While the majority are peaceful, however, several Daramarjaratan death-cults have established throughout the years, normally being stomped out by their fellow faithful before they can cause harm. This is not always successful however, most notably when these death cults came together with the Vidvaookeyatranian lack of scrutiny leading to the [murtuy_ka_varha|E]."

There is no heaven and hell, though there is a (still mundane) spiritual realm from which ghosts and spirits manifest.\n\nMany have said that Asritaykanism is to philosophy what Vidvaookeyatranism is to science, the faithful spending their time endlessly debating philosophical concepts instead of spiritual ones, though the works of the philosopher [saru|e] have brought great hostility. While a traditionally small philosophy, Asritaykanist philosophers can be found in nearly every single realm across Kashirya, often entertained by local rulers and considered generally harmless."
