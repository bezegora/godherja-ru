 #Black martyr
 black_martyr:0 "Cult of the Black Martyr"
 black_martyr_desc:0 "Those of the Black Martyr's cult are seen as deviants and overly eccentric even by other Redlanders. A sect dedicated to the veneration of the legendary 'Black Martyr' who sacrificed much in the pursuit of knowledge. Finally achieving understanding of Aeras and its inner workings drove the Black Martyr mad, and left him a gibbering husk requiring aid from numerous sacred custodians. These custodians dress their charge in black robes and attempt to divide his deranged but oftentimes oracular ramblings into those that are incomprehensible to our mortal ken and those that can be deciphered with great effort.  However, these custodians are at the best of times inaccurate and have but rarely managed to predict future happenings. Most believe that this is due to their incompetence, with the erratic behavior of the custodians doing little to assuage their doubts. A select few are of the school that this is due to the Black Martyr’s abilities not being truly prophetic but instead enabling the madman to foresee all possible futures. More sinisterly, in recent times the Black Martyr’s ramblings have begun to fixate almost exclusively on cataclysmic events, and the Martyr himself has grown more and more distressed, at times even screaming in anguish before falling into a catatonic state. Even the maddened Martyr is left in despair at the horrific doom that lies ahead."

 #Spider Feast
 
 spider_feast:0 "The Spider Feast"
 spider_feast_desc:0 "The Spider Feast worships the Spider Goddess Arannia above all others, and see the terrifying Giant Spiders throughout the Redland as not terrifying predators, but emissaries of her divine will. Temples of the Spider Feast consist mostly of lavishly decorated rooms which these Spiders call home. To keep these spiders fed, live humans are brought to the temples and given to the Spiders to Feast upon. It is believed that by serving these divine beasts, followers will gain some of their great power in exchange for their piety.\n\nWhile keeping these beasts in city centers may sound volatile at best, the claim that they bring favor to those loyal to them is not without merit. Most directly, the silk and poison leftover from the Feast can be made into sturdy armor and deadly weapons. However, more famously, whenever a town of the Spider Feast is attacked, the Giant Spiders who call it their home will defend it with their lives."

 #Fallen Star
 fallen_star:0 "The Cult of the Fallen Star"
 fallen_star_desc:0 "The enigmatic cult of the Fallen Star is one that continually baffles outsiders, with its principles being bewildering at best and deeply disconcerting at worst. The cultists themselves revere a creature known only as the ‘Fallen Star’ whose whereabouts seem to be constantly in flux. Its moniker, the Fallen Star derives from its supposed stellar origins, as well as its imposing appearance. The true origin of this extraterrestrial is vague, but most say that its appearance as a figure hurtling towards the Redlands coincided with the sudden disappearance of a star in the night sky, and it is unlike any other creature known to exist on Aeras. Possessing thousands of stonelike arms and legs, the entity is exceedingly adept in what appears to be Mind Magic, and puzzlingly enough even teaches a select few of its followers in the art. All those that have witnessed the Fallen Star claim it to be a transcendent being, and few did not shortly thereafter initiate themselves into their eponymous cult. The creature preaches that enlightenment can only be obtained when one realizes the current meaningless of life on Aeras. It also claims that this can only be rectified by it, and that true meaning can only be obtained through the worship of the Fallen Star. Those that do not accept the Fallen Star into their hearts must be ground to dust and removed from this world, for they are the propagators of mankind’s current state. Conquest, death and war are the instruments of this Fallen Star, and it will strive to grant man purpose at any cost."

 devourer_of_all_desc:0 "The cult of the All-Devourer believes that the world is not only created by their patron goddess, but also destroyed by her. Every ten thousand years, the world is born anew, carefully seeded and nurtured by the mother goddess. But over time, mankind's sins and perversions inevitably cause the world to be filled with rot and corruption. When the ten thousand years are up and the mother goddess finds her creation too far gone to salvage, she devours it and births a new world, hopefully free of sin this time around.\n\nIn centuries past, the cult may have focused on performing good deeds, in hopes of proving to the goddess that their world is worth sparing. But they have grown convinced that this cycle is irreparably damaged, and thus they try to cope with the reality that they are living in a doomed world."

They maintain fires within grandiose temples that are believed essential to establishing communion with the glorious flame. Those who tend the most immense flames are esteemed above the rest for fulfilling their duty to the divine blaze. At the end of days, they believe the Flame Eternal will descend upon Aeras itself, using the infernos maintained by its faithful worshippers to take on a magnificent form before rewarding its loyal followers and turning to those who refused its holiness, wiping them out through means of a great firestorm that will sweep Aeras and leave only the faithful who stood true in its wake. However, in recent decades the Flame Eternal has been seen flickering, suddenly disappearing from existence before reappearing just as suddenly. The cultists vehemently preach that this is due to the Flame Eternal lacking kindling and accordingly have decided to take drastic measures to procure new kindling for the dwindling fires. They now wish to set all that is alight, in hopes of preserving the heavenly blaze and they care not for the consequences."

Foremost of their beliefs is that Aervalr speaks to a chosen few, attuned to the divinity, and unlike mere mortals have the uncanny ability to perceive and furthermore understand its divine speech. The tenets of their faith come from the various interpretations of these priests which contradict each other and are often nonsensical and ridiculous, with one priest claiming Aervalr had spoken to them and required that the faithful must now forego the wearing of clothes, which was immediately rebuked by another priest asserting that Aervalr had told the faithful to wear more clothes. This caused a schism that lasted nearly a century with a third preacher pronouncing that Aervalr had commanded no such change of the sort eventually triumphing, though countless other schisms have occurred since due to conflicting interpretations by priests.

 bloody_feast_desc:0 "The cultists of the Bloody Feast obey the commands of their priests who interpret the teachings of what they believe to be a being who voluntarily descended from the heavens to relay holy instructions to his chosen flock. This entity is said to lurk within a great subterranean lair filled with relics of unknown make, and is said to possess an otherworldly beauty and enchanting voice. It verbalizes its commandments to chosen priests in a strange and unnatural language, somehow innately understood by those who hear it. These commandments emphasize the sanctity of blood and speak of an enigmatic concept only known as the Bloody Feast. Through the usage of the blood of man in the Bloody Feast, the cultists believe one can rise above the rest of humanity, and reincarnate into something greater than the rest of the fetid masses of mankind. The blood required for the Bloody Feast is collected with the utmost brutality that involves careful dismemberment and flaying of the reservoir, to preserve its life to the end of the ritual. The sheer immensity of the pain and suffering endured by the victim in the midst of this procedure is thought to draw the attention of outer entities who pave the path to renewal. The final steps to obtaining rebirth through the Bloody Feast are unknown, besides the fact that it requires an enormity of sacred blood."

Even the cult is not clear if the enigmatic focus of their devotion is a god, an immortal magi sage, or something else entirely. What they do know is that They have wandered Aeras for countless ages, and appeared to devotees in both the real world and in their dreams. Despite Their apparent ambivalence to Their following, the Cult has filled hundreds of books recounting encounters with the Great Unknown One, certain to the point of obsession that if they can discern Their purpose the cult will unlock one of Aeras' greatest and most powerful secrets. Then, they will be able to bring the whole world of doubters and fools to its knees."

 #Zegarillian Dance
 zegarillian_dance:0 "Circle of the Zegarillian Dance"
 zegarillian_dance_desc:0 "The Circle of the Zegrillian Dance believe they are servants of the true masters of reality, the so-called "Hidden Kings", men turned gods who rule from a spiritual realm located within the hollow shell of Aeras. The cult believe their masters communicate with them via messages sent in the apparently random emanations of unleashed magic. As such, they treat exposure sickness and mutation as a holy sacrament to be experienced both personally and to be inflicted upon outsiders, all so the faithful may divine the will of the gods in its patterns. The eponymous "Dance" is the sum of the enigmatic movements hidden in both the arcane and the mundane.\n\n The Circle's slavish worship of Magi and magic has made it an attractive destination for rogue Aversarian Magi. It's commonly suspected that the cult was likely descended from a slave-cult established by one or more such exiles, as its pantheon of "Hidden Kings" is rather obviously cobbled together from the garbled names and personas of reigning Aautokratirs of antiquity."

 #Elated Victim
 elated_victim:0 "Cult of the Elated Victim"
 elated_victim_desc:0 "The aberrant and continually recurring cult of the Elated Victim is among the most bizarre of all the cults within the Redlands, and the few scholars studying the region have struggled greatly in their attempts to make sense of the cult. Wherever the Kesrravarga appear, these cultists are soon to follow and they are known to disappear once the Kesrravarga they have been hosted by perishes. However, a few instances of the cult have managed to persist even beyond the death of their Kesrravarga, though exactly why is uncertain. They worship a woman of ethereal nature called the ‘Elated Victim’, who manifests only within the tentacles of the great and venerable Kesrravarga, beasts notorious for their gluttony native to the Redlands. She speaks to her followers of the sanctity of consumption, indulgence and edacity. Her followers preach of the transience of life, and that pleasure must be sought at all costs. Seemingly in contradiction to their hedonistic beliefs, they also exalt death, pain and all forms of suffering and view the most tormented among humanity as holy. They are also known to frequently indulge in massive orgies that involve a mix of both lustful elation and murderous rages. A strange cult to be sure, and the reasons for its constant disappearance and reappearance across the ages remain yet unknown."

 #Burning Maiden

 burning_maiden_desc:0 "The exact historical identity of the original 'Burning Maiden' worshipped by her eponymous cult is unknown, if in fact she ever existed at all. According to the teachings and legends that surround her, she is a being that is periodically reborn on Aeras to sow great discord and bring about change - sometimes under the guise of casting down the wicked and evil, but just as often as nothing more than a power-hungry usurper. The one universal constant of her manifestations, however, is that she always has her life ended in fire, until born anew.\n\nFurthemore, it is rumored that her followers believe that while she is not physically present on Aeras, they may communicate with her and receive wisdom in a limited fashion through an elaborate ritual that involves the burning of a live maiden - though of course, for the sake of propriety, a substitute effigy is used when political circumstances prohibit the original ritual."

The Church believes it is their duty to rescue their patron, and they do so by digging man-sized "seer pits" that go as deep into the soil and stone of Aeras as they can go. When they hear groaning and moaning from far below, they believe they're hearing the cries of Aasakh, calling out instructions to them to liberate him from his torture. Members of the Church are infamous for their haunting chants and hymns, which imitate the wails of their god."

Yalgabaoti believe that the gods are incomprehensible and inhuman in aspect and thought; mortal men cannot understand them, and anyone who beholds their physical form is struck dead or is turned mad. Yalgabaoti worship the gods in order to attain knowledge and understanding of the physical world, which they believe to be the dream of the Unspeakable God, the originator of all things. This worship is believed not to grant them any boons, since mortals are as maggots before the gods. Supplication before the gods therefore takes the form of studying natural and unnatural phenomena, giving sacrifices to Yalgabaot and his servitors, and participating in magic rituals in honor of the gods in the hopes that a fraction of their presence can be invoked."
