 ancient_religion_desc:0 "The world is full of faiths and religions, not all of which have been able to maintain worshippers through the present day.

 starvayrd_desc:0 "Starvayrd is based around the belief that the Gods and spirits are interchangeable, and that the first Gods were merely the spirits of faded stars. Starvayrdi believe that one can see their destiny by looking to these stars, and by tracking the signs in the sky at a child's birth. However, the destiny will be lost if not strived for, and that it is every good Starvayrdi's goal in life to achieve it."
