 arnazni_religion_desc:0 "Arnazni is a religion that sees the world as a challenge that one must overcome to ascend as a god. One must live their life according to the teachings of their ancestors, never cower in front of anything, and pay respects to one's most venerated ancestors. They believe that the Armazli Mountains that protect them from the northern barbarians were made by their ancestors who held godlike magical powers; however, as time went on, these beings started to lose their might due to becoming content and soft. An exception to this were the three brothers Arnaz, Azot, and Zalden. They were disgusted with their peers' new habits and all three made a new mountain. Arnaz, being eldest and wisest, was crowned high king, and so after some time, they started a war to unify the land. In the conquests, however, Azot became jealous at the success of his eldest brother and betrayed him, which led to the death of Arnaz. Before he did, however, a curse was laid upon everyone, which led to a great reduction of magical capabilities. Furthermore, Arnaz proclaimed that his son would kill Azot and reclaim the high kingship, and so it was that after many years, a young man named Parnaz, with aid from Zalden, would slay Azot in a duel and reclaim the throne. The great mountain on which his father was crowned would be renamed in his honor, and no foul man or beast may step foot on it. Parnaz would reign for many centuries, and with that almost everyone in arnazni would be related to him. However, his direct line is counted as the most purest, and they would rule the land for many centuries and establish a strong society of warriors."

 azot_desc:0 "The Cult of Azot completely eschews the veneration of Arnaz 'the Great Ancestor', whom they consider an upjumped pretender with a legacy built on nothing on lies, and instead worship the eponymous martyred God-King Azot 'the Great'. Unlike most of their other kindred, they deemphasize the importance of martial prowess and valor, instead believing that power in its more general form is the true marker of spiritual ascendance. Furthermore, its adherents generally hold the belief that Azot will one day return to the mortal world and seek vengeance against the children of Arnaz."

The cult's teachings hold that the world has already long since descended into the dark age of moral degeneracy, weakness and effete decadence that Arnaz 'the Great Ancestor' had warned of (most other Amaghean branches holding the view that said era has not yet come) and that salvation will only come with the return of the Truthspeakers. Aeras now awaits their revival by the all-father, and once they retake their birthright they will deliver Amaghea into righteousness yet again and begin an eternal golden age."

They claim that Arnaz was the reason that the heavens were forever sealed off, and that he fabricated reasons for his unjust war of destruction together with his brothers. Azot would soon realize that his elder brother spoke with a forked tongue and ended up casting him down to the crimson abyss. However, it was far too late, and the carnage and destruction from this war made the lands unliveable. The great ancestors gave up their lives to heal the lands. Azot would try to spread the truth; however, he would be savagely murdered by the demon spawn of Arnaz."
