 marcher_religion_desc:0 "Unlike other religions, adherents of the Life Path care more about the journey through life than they do about the destination in the afterlife. They believe in a "clockmaker's universe," where all of existence is a perfect machine, but it may only function if certain roles are properly fulfilled by mankind. As the first and greatest of Wayfathers Sir Ranos laid out for the Marcher people, there are a multitude of different ways in life that people may follow, but within certain guidelines. All harmony comes from people following these ways as intended, and all chaos is caused by the refusal to do so.\n\nWhile [clerical_control_of_chevalie|E] has always been fairly heavy-handed, the Conclave of Raocourt became the undisputed leader of the Lifepaths after the [war_of_the_heretic_princes|E], declaring schismaticism to be arch-heresy in the 1011 IS Council of Ex. Since Raocourt's victory, most Lifepath faithful have followed a version of the faith in which orthodoxy is tightly controlled by the reigning Council there."

They are tutored and initiated in this path by a Wayfather, one skilled in their role who has dedicated their life to helping others. In their tutelage, they study the ways of revered Wayfathers and Waymothers of the past, who were so renowned that their deeds passed on into legend."

 becledienism_adherent_plural:0 "Becledites"
 becledienism_desc:0 "Becledienism is a Marcher belief system founded by the radical monk Urso Becledièvre during the 'War of the Heretic Princes' period of Chevalien history. Becledienism revolves around the concept that ones Lifepath is chosen at birth and not by the adherent's own self, and that a Wayfather must foretell the Path at birth by looking to the stars. Declared arch heresy at the Council of Ex along with the rest of the heresies spawned in the period, it nonetheless continued on for several decades after its compatriot heresies thanks to the relatively small number of (major) differences between the baseline faith."

 darrallianism_adherent_plural:0 "Darrallianists"
 darrallianism_desc:0 "Darrallianism is a heresy of the Lifepath founded by the noblewoman turned preacher Cathrène den va Darrall. Exceptionally esoteric in its beliefs, Darrallianism is an incredibly complex series of challenges to mainline Lifepath beliefs, but most notably is the concept of the Tripath; that the only Paths one can walk are the Paths of War, Peace and Death. Equally important to the faith was the concept of the dominance of the theocratic class, claiming that Wayfathers and Waymothers should have exclusive leadership of their flock, and that Chevaliens should live in covens based around their local waymeet in order to be closer to their fath. This, combined with the belief that anyone could be a Wayfather, led to several dozen lords proclaiming themselves Wayfathers and using the faith to pursue reunification of the Marches.\n\nWhile most of the heresy was stomped out in the closing days of the War of the Heretic Princes and the burning of its founder at the stake, it has nonetheless reappeared up from time to time over the centuries."

 arderism_adherent_plural:0 "Arderists"
 arderism_desc:0 "Arderists (from the Chevalien word for 'burning') preach that the idolization of all Gods, Waysaints and of anything else not connected to the material world was the gravest of sins and believed that only be sealing oneself off from the 'ethereal' could all [liches|E] (and all [magi|E]) finally be destroyed. While initially ignored, adherents rapidly gained wide attention by burning dozens of churches and hundreds of religious artifacts in northern Chevalie, and several warlords quickly began adopting it during the War of the Heretic Princes in order to take more church land.\n\nNobody knows who truly founded the religion, the enigmatic 'Black Monk' that is claimed to have been the first preacher never having been found, and it was stamped out not long before the end of the war. Many Chevalien historians consider Arderism to be the main reason for the collapse of church power in central Chevalie, which it never truly recovered from."

 saintsmarch_adherent_plural:0 "Saintsmarcher"
 saintsmarch_desc:0 "Saintsmarch, a heresy appearing during the War of the Heretic Princes period of Chevalien history, can be described as a revanchist psuedo-religious philosophical movement spearheaded by veteran [antimagi|E] turned prophet Wildermutt den va Seyseunns. A highly militarized version of the Lifepath, adherents upheld the Way of Nullification and the Way of Swords above all others and claimed that there could be no peace on Aeras until every last [magi|E] was dead.\n\nWhile briefly entertained by several lords, the movement rapidly lost control as adherents began sacking foreign quarters across the Chevalien coast and attacking foreign advisors and courtiers to the nobility, and then promptly began lynching the nobility themselves who they saw as being ill-prepared for their rapidly approaching 'True War' against the [magi|E] of the world.\n\nWildermutt was eventually turned on by his own followers and beaten to death with stones after it was revealed he had actually been a walker of the Way of Harvests, and the movement soon collapsed due to infighting and mistrust."

 innerpath_desc:0 "The 'Inner Path' is actually a loose name for several versions of the Lifepath normally practiced in the more remote or rugged parts of Chevalie, primarily the mountainous interior where the last of the Gallicaders remain. Far looser in many rules and in nature than the mainstream Lifepath, it is the result of Lifepath preachers attempting to reconcile several native Gallicader beliefs with those of their faith.\n\nWhile it has slowly fallen out of favor and has been generally shunned out of Marcher society - especially after the general hostilities against factionalism in the faith following the War of the Heretic Princes - it is nonetheless still popular in some circles."

 coastpath_desc:0 "The 'Coast Path' is an exceptionally loose gathering of several dozen separate faiths that are native to the Konijkmener coasts as well as southeastern Chevalie. The fusing of native beliefs in oceanic and river based pantheons with the Lifepath, it enjoyed several hundred years of relative isolation before being stamped out brutally by Konen Brooeden of the Konijkmener in 772 IS as part of his attempts to centralize the realm. With much of the faith destroyed and little interest or need for it in Chevalie, the Chevaliens soon after began their own process of rooting out the native faiths, though pockets have doggedly survived throughout the centuries."

 four_steps_of_salvation_desc:0 "The Four Steps of Salvation was a heresy of the Lifepath formed in the mid 9th century by Chevalien aristocrat Thiscul den va Vescot. Salvationists preach that the four true paths are the Way of Pain, the Way of Blood, the Way of Dread, and the Way of Fear, and demanded of its followers everything from ritualized cannibalism to mass torture and murder indiscriminate of station, gender or age.\n\nAlways on the fringe, Salvationists entered the public eye after a string of brutal murders in Peti Gisredde, and briefly rose up in several cities before being brutally stomped down on by an inquisitorial force along with over a dozen knightly orders. Thiscul himself, along with his entire dynasty, was publically executed, and 'Thiscul' is now considered something akin to a heretical curse word in Chevalien society."

 conclave_of_opakhasia_desc:0 "Founded by Lifepather missionaries, the Conclave of Opakasija was officialy formed with the codification of the 'Eastern Paths'. A strange merging of pagan Sjalvolki myth and the Lifepaths of the Marchers, the Conclave of Opakasija preaches the existence of four distinct Lifepaths. The Path of the Hunt, focused on the improvement of one's inner self; the Path of the Sword, focused on practicing war and training the body; the Path of the Shepherd, focused on practicing peaceful pursuits and training the mind; and the Path of the Stars, focusing on magic and trickery.\n\nWhile initially seen as an odd but promising offshoot of the mainstream Marcher faith, with many expecting it to one day join proper northern dogma with the increasing of ties, the Entreatment of Ventell led to the Conclave of Opakasija being declared arch-heresy. With the breaking of ties, the southern worshippers formed their own Conclave to oppose the now antagonistic northerners, and the practices of the southern faith rapidly separated from mainstream Marcher rite."

 conclave_of_gisredde_desc:0 "The Conclave of Gisredde can be best described as an 'anti-Conclave' to the Conclave of Raocourt. With [peti_gisredde|E] historically chaffing under any sort of outside interference, it should have been expected that they would inevitability dispute (often violently) the influence of 'foreign' churches, even those of the same faith within the same realm that practice the same culture.\n\nFirst declared in 389 IS with the [pontgonez_dispute|E], the Conclave would fade out of relevance and then suddenly return every few decades. Normally, this would coincide with the Conclave of Raocourt's attempts to enforce any amount of orthodoxy on the always individualistic Gisreddeans, with the 'schism' only ended once they gave the local wayfathers a significant tax decrease."
