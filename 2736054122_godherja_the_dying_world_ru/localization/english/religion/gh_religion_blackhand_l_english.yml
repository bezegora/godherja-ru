 blackhand_religion_desc:0 "The Cult of the Black Hand was an Aversarian cult centered around an enigmatic figure known as "the Mindseeker." The Cult held the Mindseeker as an all-powerful being and prophet, capable of predicting the future, seeing the past, and of bestowing great powers upon their followers. The Seeker themself preached the idea that all gods are to be rejected and killed, as it is the gods of man which once destroyed the world and would again. Followers of the Mindseeker destroyed all religious iconography and scripture they could, and attempted to learn the "true names" of gods, driven by the belief that speaking a deity's true name would kill them."
