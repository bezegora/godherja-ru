Yeru-mai once tried to slay her husband in a fit of jealousy, but was stopped by their eldest son Ölik at the cost of his life. Their second son Kaigan, covering his face at the sight, fled and swore to never build a home of earth or harvest its fruits. And from Kaigan's loins came all the peoples of the steppe."

 cumani_adj:0 "Öltenic"
 cumani_adjherent:0 "Ölteni"
 cumani_adherent_plural:0 "Öltenis"
 cumani_desc:0 "The Öltenis believe that if they leave their faces exposed for too long, jealous Yeru-mai will identify them as Kalgan's children and steal their souls away. Thus, they conceal themselves with facemasks, which they always wear when outside or in the company of others. These masks are only removed during intimate or ritually important moments, as a sign of pure loyalty and vulnerability."

 iek_otached_adj:0 "Iek Otachedian"
 iek_otached_adherent:0 "Iek Otachedi"
 iek_otached_adherent_plural:0 "Iek Otachedis"
 iek_otached_desc:0 "Iek Otached (meaning 'Great Otached') is an Öltenic faith centered around the Öltenic warlord Otached from which most modern Öltenic culture and religion (as well as their very entrance to relevance to [the_continent|E]) have descended from. While contemporarious to Otached's life, there is little record of Otached actually patronizing his cult or paying it any mind at all. Instead, the cult only began to gain any traction upon his death, and then truly began to establish itself only with the death of Otached's grandson Baytor in the disastrous [bayyuralar|E].\n\nWith Baytor dead and his armies largely trapped in Aironoi, the cult began to spread rapidly across his armies, holding Otached up as truly the descendent of the gods and also a physical reflection of Kaigan himself. The Iek Otachedis still follow the majority of Öltenic orthodoxy (as little consistency is seen among the faithful, at least) but hold Otached himself up as one of its many gods."

 arayymorog_adj:0 "Araaymörögism"
 arayymorog_adherent:0 "Araaymörögian"
 arayymorog_adherent_plural:0 "Araaymörögians"
 arayymorog_desc:0 "Araaymörög, or 'Air Worship', is an umbrella term for Öltenic faiths which claim that the many gods are reflected on [aeras|E] through the movements and actions of the air and wind. Araaymörögians claim that everything from the rushing of wind through a mountain-pass to a slight differentiation in an area's temperature are the results of the gods interacting with the world.\n\nWhile technically the same faith as the Öltenic 'mainstream', the Araaymörögians eschew most normal attempts at divination in return for obsessive observation of the movements of the wind. Many stories tell of Araaymörög minded warlords being on the verge of victory in great battle and then ordering their warbands to retreat simply because of symbols they saw in drifting leaves on a breeze."

 chakkarai:0 "Chakkarai"
 chakkarai_adj:0 "Chakkaran"
 chakkarai_adherent:0 "Chakkaran"
 chakkarai_adherent_plural:0 "Chakkarai"
 chakkarai_desc:0 "The Chakkarai worship the conqueror Otached, calling him Chakkar-Khaitan, a title which means 'Godlike Ruler' and 'King of the Universe'. Chakkarai worship him and his family spirit, regarding the remaining descendants of Otached as possessing the touch of divinity. Although his sons were demigods, Baytor was led astray by Yeru-mai and led the Divine Empire of Otached to ruin. Baytor is now remembered as one of Yeru-mai's demons, his spirit enthralled by her to bring ruin to kings, being deceived by promises that she will release him and allow him to ascend to Heaven after his work is done.\n\nChakkarai also include many philosophical principles from Kashiryan religions in their faith, and worship at their temples freely, viewing the myriad gods of Kashirya as having been vassals of Chakkar-Otached. They believe that upon Otached's death, Ölgon-ten stepped down from his throne and crowned him Khaitan-Khaggar, King of Heaven."

 ebohephai_olten_desc:0 "The followers of Ēboheph-Ölgon (White Ölgon) believe in a wide pantheon of spirits and fire gods. In their mythology, Arlikhaan was slain by the jealous goddess Aru-men, who desired to usurp the throne of Ēboheph-Ölgon. As Arlikhaan descended into the earth, he made mortal combat against Aru-men and her five thousand demon-spirits, subduing them and banishing her to the Mountain of Pain.\n\nWorshipers of Ēboheph-Ölgon, who call themselves the Ēbohephai, do not hate the earth and consider it sacred. They bury their people in kurgans, a type of burial mound, and give worship to Arlikhaan and his five thousand demon-spirits and one hundred fire gods. His brother, Kogonhay, was given dominion of all under the sky and from him issued forth the race of man."
