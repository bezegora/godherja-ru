 mogowai_religion_desc:0 "The Mogowai believe that their god, known only as the Most High, once had a physical avatar who walked upon Aeras and interacted with supplicants. However, He was attacked by an army of nonbelievers, who burnt His temples, destroyed His offerings, and even slew Him. His body was spirited away to places unknown, and it is the duty of the Mogowai ('Searchers' in their language) to track down this body and give it proper last rites, after which the Most High shall be born in a new body and peace shall return to the world."

 special_doctrine_mogowai_hostility_desc:0 "We are tasked with a grand mission from the divine, to locate His corpse, that He might rise again. All other faiths, whatever they might preach, are merely obstacles, who have turned their followers away from the Great Search in pursuit of their own, petty, goals."
 special_doctrine_bekashai_hostility_name:0 "Soldiers of the Dead God"
 special_doctrine_bekashai_hostility_desc:0 "Long ago, foreigners destroyed our heaven, and He Who Was Most High, our divine guardian and protector, was slain. Our mission, our purpose, is singular and paramount. We exist to make the Temple-Burners pay for their crimes, to finally exact vengeance for the ancient tragedy."
 special_doctrine_nitsafai_hostility_name:0 "Bastion of Piety"
 special_doctrine_nitsafai_hostility_desc:0 "The supposed followers of He Who Was Most High stand as insults to everything He wanted. They revel in gluttonous corruption, from the lowliest Siiret to the highest Aminet. All, that is, save us. While others mock His virtues, we stand true to them. For though He is dead, His spirit is still with us, and we shall ever tread beneath His light."
 special_doctrine_marefai_hostility_name:0 "Singers of His Ancient Hymns"
 special_doctrine_marefai_hostility_desc:0 "The Hymns of Heaven, the ancient songs that have been sung since the beginning of time, are vague at places. And while others might cling to their version of the story, we allow all to choose. The Most High gave us the ability to interpret His sacred decrees, and it is beyond the purview of any mortal to tell another that their interpretation is false."
 special_doctrine_waharai_hostility_name:0 "Believers in His Ascencion"
 special_doctrine_waharai_hostility_desc:0 "The others are fools, for a god can never truly die. He Who Was Most High awaits us, the true faithful, in heaven, and all others are merely heretics. To reject His ascension is to reject Him, and we have no obligation to accept those who fail this basic test of faith."

 mogowai_adherent_plural:0 "Mogowai"
 mogowai_desc:0 "The mainstream Mogowai, codified under the [boqqarut|E], take their task of finding the body of the Most High incredibly seriously. While a good many just pray that He leads His followers to His final resting place, others are compelled to go out into the world and search themselves. They retread old paths thought to be dead ends, or search in completely undiscovered locales, and pursue any lead about a sacred burial site in hopes of fulfilling their one goal. It is believed that when found, He will rise once more, and transform the world into a paradise."

 bekashai_adherent_plural:0 "Bekashai"
 bekashai_desc:0 "The Bekashai hold that those who slew the Most High must be brought to justice, believing that only through attaining revenge can His body be found. They have refocused their efforts to search the world, ignoring the quest for His body itself and instead seeking out His killers, hoping to one day avenge their ancient sin. A variety of theories as to His death have been proposed, but most tend to simply blame one's current enemies for the long-ago tragedy"

 nitsafai_adherent:0 "Nitsafai"
 nitsafai_adherent_plural:0 "Nitsafai"
 nitsafai_desc:0 "The Nitsafai believe that the mainstream Mogowai have lost their way, due largely to the meddling of secular leaders in religious affairs. They push for a literal interpretation of the Hymns of Heaven, and pursue a refocusing of the faith before the search can resume, fearing that corruption will prevent His body from ever being discovered. This dedication causes them to uphold their orthodoxy above all else, and any deviation from their truth is harshly punished."

 marefai_adherent_plural:0 "Marefai"
 marefai_desc:0 "While other denominations believe in centralized efforts to seek out His body, the Marefai decry central religious authority entirely, believing that mere mortals are unworthy to dictate the orders of the Most High. They encourage everyone to live their lives in accordance with their own interpretations of the Hymns, and see those who would attempt to lead the faith as usurpers. Despite their variety of beliefs, the quest for His tomb remains paramount, along with most other core tenets."

 waharai_adherent_plural:0 "Waharai"
 waharai_desc:0 "The Waharai hold that the Most High’s death was merely His ascension, and that He waits in the heavens for those who accept this truth. Their attitude towards piety is far more lax than their fellows, to the Waharai, your actions on Aeras matter not, as merely the belief in the Most High will earn you a reward. As a result, the rules they follow are less formal and structured, with far more leeway given to individuals that would have been punished by other faiths, so long as they maintain their beliefs."
