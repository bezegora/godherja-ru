 bm_the_dying_world_1254:0 "The Dying World"
 bm_the_dying_world_1254_desc:0 "Aversaria sits in its final moments.\n\nCenware Witch-Breaker and his Sjalvolki Imperrech, a coalition of hundreds of tribes from dozens of cultures dedicated solely to dividing the ailing Aversarinas Aautokratia, pour south into the remains of the dead state. The grand alliance that sought to put an end to the barbarian ambition is shattered, the Elysian Pass putting a final nail in the Empire's coffin.\n\nAcross the world, entire peoples reel in shock. All across former Aversaria, warlords of all stripes attempt to take their piece of what little safe land remains untouched by the Fog, in Sarradon the final battle between the Agionists and the native Sarradonians continues, and in the Marches, the children of the missing High King Gardfrei tear Chevalie apart in their battle to secure the broken crown."

  bookmark_the_dying_world_rene_de_va_seignon_desc:0 "Born to a maid in a foreign court, René was forced to fight for his place among the family, and left to form his own mercenary company years before his father's journey north and subsequent disappearance.\n\nNow his father is gone, and his brothers have taken to fighting over the spoils. After narrowly escaping with his men from the Elysian Pass - earning a salute from the Witch-Breaker himself.\n\n#bold René and his company have now made landfall in southern Chevalie. Will you rise to the occasion and prove that no matter your birth, you are the true son to your father?"

  bookmark_the_dying_world_cenware:0 "Cenware 'Witch-Breaker'"
  bookmark_the_dying_world_cenware_desc:0 "Glory to the Witch-Breaker! The first man to unite the Sjalvolki clans and history as just a boy, the first to burn the [mayikprolollan|E]'s libraries not long after, and soon to be the man who put the [aversarian|E] beast to its rightful death. Behind Cenware sits a hundred cultures united in one purpose, settling their people in the fertile lands of the Empire.\n\n#bold But the Imperrech is not to last, by its very design. Once the Empire is gone, the clans of the Imperrech have each been promised their own slice of land, and already former friends have begun to bite at one another for the crumbs. Can you unite the Sjalvolki people, and begin a new era for the world?"

  bookmark_the_dying_world_nicanoneus:0 "Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun'"
  bookmark_the_dying_world_nicanoneus_desc:0 "There is only war to the Black Sun.\n\nHis life one long battle, he has fought from his homeland in the far east of the Imperial colonies to the mountains of the Marches themselves. His home swept by [fog|E], its last remnants now settled by barbarous scum, Nicanoneus is a man with nothing left to lose. So he shall win it all.\n\n#bold The only man to defeat Cenware in open battle, the only [aversarian|E] to command a legion of the barbarians themselves, it is only right that his men revere him as divinity. But is divinity enough to save [aversaria|E]?"

  bookmark_the_dying_world_harthah:0 "Ḥārthah ibn Sarradon"
  bookmark_the_dying_world_harthah_desc:0 "The Agionist Orders claim purity and virtue, but none more than the Father of [sarradon|E] know that these are lies. They are disgusting impure creatures, that have set themselves down the path of destroying [sarradon|E] and no doubt opening wide the gates to the Hooded Prisoner. He learnt this truly when his wife was taken by the slaving scum. And when his master refused to allow him to free her, it dawned on him that only he could save his land.\n\n#bold To Ḥārthah, all of [sarradon|E] are his children, and it is his holy mission to see that none of them will ever fear the 'holy' orders again. Can you finally end a thousand years of war, and unite the people of [sarradon|E] against their invaders?"

  bookmark_the_dying_world_hacaeda_desc:0 "Across untold lengths the Legion marched, to return home from the east to a broken state. And we have nobody to blame but ourselves.\n\n[aversarians|E] caused this, [aversarians|E] oppressed and destroyed and burned. Legon Valerix, Purest rest his soul, knew this more than any other. He taught me this when he adopted me on the trail so long ago, and even though he now lies dead I shall see his mission complete.\n\n#bold Can you finish Valerix's work and bring a new age to [aversaria|E], and right the wrongs and evil of your ancestors? And more pressingly, can you find his killer?"
