 bm_the_broken_crown_1254_desc:0 "High King Gardfrei de va Seignon may have once been a good monarch, depending on who was asked, but his obsession with his secret mission consumed him and by the end of his reign the High Kingdom was ruled by an absent lord. When the various claimants to the throne gathered in the 1251 Council of Grapannes, he famously broke his crown apart and threw it at the claimants, telling them that whomever could gather the pieces could rule for all he cared of such 'petty concerns'. Now the High King is gone, leaving north with his most trusted comrades, and the High Kingdom bleeds."

  bookmark_the_broken_crown_rene_de_va_seignon_desc:0 "Born to a maid in a foreign court, René was forced to fight for his place among the family, and left to form his own mercenary company years before his father's journey north and subsequent disapearance.\n\nNow his father is gone, and his brothers have taken to fighting over the spoils. After narrowly escaping with his men from the Elysian Pass - earning a salute from the Witch-Breaker himself.\n\n#bold René and his company have now made landfall in southern Chevalie. Will you rise to the occasion and prove that no matter your birth, you are the true son to your father?"

  bookmark_the_broken_crown_cliement:0 "Cliément de va Seignon"
  bookmark_the_broken_crown_cliement_desc:0 "The youngest of the Den va Seignon brothers, Cliément was spirited away from the capital shortly after his father's disappearance by his mother, who feared for his safety.\n\nNow she rules as his regent, but as she falls deeper into the arms of the mercenary, Engelmar Den va Spencer, many wonder if the young king has simply fallen into a far greater danger...\n\n#bold But a child, nobody knows what type of man Cliément will become. Will you become a good king or a petty despot? Will you defeat your brothers? And will you survive the intrigues of the court?"

  bookmark_the_broken_crown_ansfrei:0 "Ansfrei de va Seignon"
  bookmark_the_broken_crown_ansfrei_desc:0 "The studious brother, Ansfrei grew up wanting little to do with the throne, dreaming of a life surrounded by fellow scholars and thinkers. Now, however, his father is gone, and his homeland burns. Ansfrei may be no great warrior, and may lack most of the traits considered kingly in Chevalie, but he believes that only he can be the one to save it.\n\n#bold Ansfrei is a thinker, not a warrior, but perhaps Chevalie needs a great mind if it is to be saved. Will you prove to your brothers that it is words, not swords, that will save the land?"

  bookmark_the_broken_crown_mathilde:0 "Mathilde"
  bookmark_the_broken_crown_mathilde_desc:0 "A peasant from birth, Mathilde clawed her way to peaks that other women of her station would never think possible. From nothing to spymaster to the High King, Mathilde's ambition has always been clear. With High King Gardfrei dead, Mathilde now sees opportunity, where others see disaster.\n\n#bold Those few who know Mathilde know to fear her, but none expect her to truly rise to the position she seeks. Will you prove them wrong, and declare yourself the first High Queen in generations?"

  bookmark_the_broken_crown_magi:0 "Hammart 'Twist-Tongue'"
  bookmark_the_broken_crown_magi_desc:0 "Some say Hammart was cursed at birth. Not only was he born with a lisp and a limp, not only was he born to parents who would go missing at sea before his first summer, and not only did he shortly after lose his inheritance as his uncle's business ventures failed, Hammart was born a [magi|E] in a society that despised him for it. \n\nBut Hammart has a plan, and Hammart knows the true way. The Marches are dying, and it is magic that must save it. Grown now, and a self made man, Hammart will find what has stolen the gift of magic from Chevalie, and he will destroy it.\n\n#bold Hammart is poor of health and has little power, but has grand designs well above his means. Will you finish his quest to bring magic back to the north? And can you deal with the consequences?"

  bookmark_the_broken_crown_ogiers:0 "Ogier 'the Ogre'"
  bookmark_the_broken_crown_ogiers_desc:0 "Ogier 'the Ogre' has been called the quintessential [antimagi|E] by many, and a living folk-hero to many more. Having been born in a small village in Laviec to a minor noble family only a generation removed from peasantry, he joined the [antimagic|E] '[antimagic_order_noprefix|E] of the Burning Star' at 12 after his home village was wiped out in a [lich|E] raid. By 19 he was knighted, having single handedly held a bridge against a horde of undead with nothing besides a dagger and a log, earning him his nickname. Not long after he was the Grandmaster, and not long after that was named heir of the ailing Duke of Banereset.\n\n#bold Having resigned his post, Ogier now stands as a feudal lord, but perhaps the only one who understands the threat of the north. Will Ogier work under a new king to prepare for this threat, or will he be forced to take matters into his own hands and reunite the broken kingdom?"

  bookmark_the_broken_crown_benouet_de_va_seignon:0 "Benouét de va Seignon"
  bookmark_the_broken_crown_benouet_de_va_seignon_desc:0 "Benouét was High King Gardfrei's first son, and thus the traditional successor to his title. While the heir-apparent was born healthy and hale, however, he seemed to have only been born with half a mind. Declared incapable by many, Benouét struggles to so much as dress himself most days, and the various claimants to the throne have all pointed this out many times over.\n\n#bold Despite his incapabilities, Benouét is surrounded by a host of loyal advisors working to aid the traditional heir (and no doubt extract the rewards), and occupies the High Kingdom's capital and most wealthy provinces. Can you secure the pieces of the Broken Crown, despite the opposition?"
