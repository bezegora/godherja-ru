 bm_wraith_of_the_north_1254:0 "Wrath of the North"
 bm_wraith_of_the_north_1254_desc:0 "For too long have effeminate southerners trampled the continent under their heel in their petty attempts at imperialism and domination! For too long has their magic corrupted the earth, poisoned the waters, and done horrors upon man!\n\nThe people of the north rise up, in a great wave to tear apart the fabrics of the old world! Across what was once Aversaria the northmen pour out in a great tide. It is an age of heroes and legends, a time when any man brave of heart and skilled with a blade may cement them and their dynasty in the sagas forever!"

 ### CHARACTERS

  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_ulfirx:0 "Ulfirx 'Mad Dog'"
  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_ulfirx_desc:0 "The son of one of the most powerful chieftains in the Imperrech, Ulfirx knew from a young age that if he wished, he could sit on his laurels and enjoy a life of ease and riches. But what makes a true Sjalvolki if not the call of adventure? So one sunny morning, nursing a hangover and having made a rather unfortunate pact the night prior, Ulfirx and his closest comrades stole a small fleet of ships and made landfall in [aversaria|E]. Good luck led to him destroying an entire army without swinging his axe, but now he stands alone, and surrounded by vipers.\n\n#bold Ulfirx has faced great fortune in his landing, but fortune won't carry him to true victory. Can you establish a great realm in the Isles before the arrival of Cenware, and cement your name in history?"

  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_southsjalvolki:0 "Dragos 'Serpent Speaker'"
  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_southsjalvolki_desc:0 "Dragos 'Serpent Speaker' was always considered queer, moreso when his clan discovered he had the gift of magic. Even more when they discovered his gift materialized in a talent for the ethereal. Rumors swirled. He made companions with snakes, feasted on bones, spoke to shadows. Despite this however, nothing could stop his meteoric rise to the top, especially not the tragically deceased Karthig who led the clan into southern [aversaria|E]...\n\n#bold A [mixed_magi|E] and a bold schemer, Dragos holds a powerful realm divided in loyalty. The [aversarian|E]s wish you gone, and your own people whisper nervously about your intentions. Can you defeat your enemies within and without, and establish yourself as the greatest ruler of all?"

  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_partic:0 "Eoghar-Argeadh"
  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_partic_desc:0 "Every good chief follows the words of the seers and druids without question, but have they gone too far? Their allies in the Marches betrayed, the clan cut off from the Imperrech in which they found strength, and with enemies on all sides in a land where the magic of his people's seems to have been taken from them, Eoghar-Argeadh can only wonder at what insanity will come next.\n\n#bold The seers are wise and true, but have they led you too far? Will you follow the Way for the greater good, or will you end tradition and find your own path?"

  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_cormag:0 "Cormag Fenrus 'the Old Dog'"
  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_cormag_desc:0 "When Cenware united the Sjalvolki, Cormag called him a fool. When he united with the dozens of other fleeing cultures of the north, Cormag called him insane. When Cenware declared his intention to settle upon the bones of [aversaria|E] and begin a new way, Cormag called him many more things, and took ship and sailed east. There in Asiupoli, ruined capital of [aversaria|E], he has established his clan. The Fenvir will not sit idly and grow weak in the homes of the [aversarian|E]s, they will tear down the old and forge a great new realm!\n\n#bold Having broken from Cenware, it is up to Cormag to forge his people's own destiny. But enemies are on all sides, and they grow in power. Will you establish a place for your clan of your own? Or will you prove Cenware right in your destruction?"

  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_berserker:0 "Sigrun 'Axe-in-the-Hand'"
  bookmark_wraith_of_the_north_berserker_desc:0 "Is it not the way of the Sjalvolki to fight alongside your shield-brothers and sisters, weapon in hand? To bathe in the blood of your enemies, give a great roar to shake the world, and dive headlong into a band of those you seek to kill? If this truly is what makes Sjalvolki Sjalvolki, then Sigrun may be more true to her roots than any living child of the north.\n\nMaking landfall in [aversaria|E], Sigrun has found great joy in smashing the heads of the weak and woman-like [aversarian|E]s against one another. But will she be able to cement herself as more than just a great warrior?\n\n#bold Surrounded by [aversarian|E]s and with only a short time before the arrival of Cenware, Sigrun must act quickly to truly cement her name in the sagas of her people!"
