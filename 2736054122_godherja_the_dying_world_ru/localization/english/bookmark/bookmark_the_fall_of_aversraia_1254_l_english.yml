 bm_the_fall_of_aversaria_1254:0 "Legacy of Elysia"
 bm_the_fall_of_aversaria_1254_desc:0 "Aversaria burns! Frodbrokna had set the final nails in her coffin, but it seems that the various pretenders and warlords of the once great Aautokrata have seen fit to play with its corpse until little remains but dust. Warlords of all stripes and colors do battle or fight wars so old that none can recall why they started, as the Sjalvolki threat looms ever darker on the horizon. With the Battle of the Elysian Pass having destroyed the few remaining legions of the homelands, it seems that it is only a question of when the Aversarians will be erased from history."

bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_hecaeda_desc:0 "Across untold lengths the Legion marched, to return home from the east to a broken state. And we have nobody to blame but ourselves.\n\n[aversarian|E]s caused this, [aversarian|E]s oppressed and destroyed and burned. Legon Valerix, Purest rest his soul, knew this more than any other. He taught me this when he adopted me on the trail so long ago, and even though he now lies dead I shall see his mission complete.\n\n#bold Can you finish Valerix's work and bring a new age to [aversaria|E], and right the wrongs and evil of your ancestors? And more pressingly, can you find his killer?"

bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_iyrossi_desc:0 "Born in the mountains, Sirras's family hid from the [aversarian|E]s, knowing that the last descendents of the Last Iyrossi would be killed if the [aversarian|E]s ever knew. He never met them, for the [aversarian|E]s finally found and murdered his kin in the first waves of Iyrossi rebellion. Growing up an orphan in [aversaria|E]'s legions, never knowing his birth, Sirras was the model Battle-Magi until the day he discovered his heritage.\n\n#bold A deserter on the run, Sirras has finally made his stand in the mountains near his home. Will you fulfill your destiny and avenge your forebearers, and return the Iyrian Valley back to its rightful people?"
bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_gorassos:0 "Gorassos 'Skull-Taker'"
bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_gorassos_desc:0 "The Butcher of Brauriri, the Hound of Aeschraes, Bloodfist, the Red Giant, Atovid's Sorrow, the Skull-Taker. Gorassos has had many names, and has earned each one. Bathed in blood from youth to adulthood, Gorassos can not find joy in anything besides the screams of his victims. Now, he rules one of the largest remnant states of [aversaria|E].\n\n#bold Gorassos is one of the most feared warriors of his age, but he is no statesman. Will you only be remembered in blood and sorrow, or will Gorassos be the first of a great lineage to survive the tide of history?"
bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_governor:0 "Governor Iordanes"
bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_governor_desc:0 "Opakhasia has the unique distinction of having the longest uninterrupted line of governor's from a single dynasty when compared to any other region of [aversaria|E]. Having ruled for nearly 200 years, the Adiakas family has been a proud line that has always served with distinction well and above their comrades.\n\nNow, however, the world ends. Not only [aversaria|E], but Aeras itself, and Iordanes Adiakas knows that he is the only man who can bring any hope for his people.\n\n#bold Governor Iordanes looks upon [aversaria|E]'s history in shame. He knows the retribution from the Sjalvolki is just and will come with little mercy. But perhaps, just maybe, he could be the [aversarian|E] to bring peace with the invaders, instead of more war."
bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_cois:0 "King Cois 'the Chosen of the Purest'"
bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_cois_desc:0 "A peasant boy born to nothing, thrown onto the streets of Oraispol to beg and steal as one of thousands of the faceless poor. That was until he was declared the chosen one, the true reincarnation of the Purest, the rightful ruler of [aversaria|E]. Despite this, however, it is no secret that his proclamation as the savior of the homeland was little more than a political move by Rhesus and his clergy. While Cois may rule, he does so from a gilded cage.\n\n#bold Cois may be king, but with Rhesus holding his strings and the Sjalvolki at the doorstep, does he truly rule? Will you break Cois free from his chains to prove himself more than a pampered peasant, or will you be yet another step the Sjalvolki take to victory?"

bookmark_the_fall_of_aversaria_aeschraes_desc:0 "What can be said about Aeschraes, the one who ended the world? How does one summarize the life of the most influential human in all of known history? Do you begin when he was a child, killing his own father and destroying his childhood home to avenge his murdered sister? When he became the second greatest student in the history of the [mayikprolollan|E]? The [aversarian_civil_war_no_prefix|E]? The Brauriri Massacre? The Legion Affair? [frodbrokna|E], when he ended the world? Or at seemingly the end of his reign, his followers having long abandoned him, and surrounded by none but his enemies?\n\n#bold Aeschraes is alone, cornered, with no more supporters to spare. Still claiming the title he sees as his right, Aeschraes has nothing besides his magic left to fight against what seems like the inevitable. Will you get him to his rightful throne? Or is the fate of the last Aautokaratir truly set?"
