 lawless_succession.0001.desc:0 "For months, [recipient.GetFirstName] and I have found ourselves increasingly at odds. Slight after slight our relationship deteriorated, and it has now soured to the point where the rumour mill is predicting we'll come to blows soon - and they're right.\n\nAfter a final, bitter argument, I've decided to challenge [recipient.GetFirstName] to a duel that will settle our differences once and for all. To [recipient.GetHerHis] credit, [recipient.GetSheHe] accepted. I've had to endure [recipient.GetHerHis] weak rule long enough - now is my time to rise and seize my destiny!"

 lawless_succession.0011.desc:0 "I have won. As my opponent falls to the ground, the assembly of spectators stand silent for a second, before bursting into a vigorous applause. I have proven myself as a strong leader, capable of taking my crew and lieutenants to ever greater heights of wealth and glory. Doubtless, their cheering is for the spoils, rather than for me. But for now, they sail with me."

 lawless_succession.0021.desc:0 "My challenge has been rejected. The coward who now sails at the head of the fleet has refused to prove their strength. They have, in doing so, conceded that I am the greater.\n\nAnd so I leave that fool behind, and choose my own path, leading my fleets to profit in my own name. For a weakling cannot reign on the waves."
 lawless_succession.0021.a:0 "I, however, can."
 
 lawless_succession.0022.t:0 "The Toothless Beast"
 lawless_succession.0022.desc:0 "The enmity between [recipient.GetFirstName] and [actor.GetFirstName] has been growing into a bitterly divisive feud that is now threatening to split the realm apart. After months of mutual provocations and slights, [actor.GetFirstName] has challenged [actor.GetHerHis] rival to a duel to settle their differences once and for all.\n\nIn a pathetic show of weakness, however, [recipient.GetFirstName] has decided to cower in fear and refuse! [actor.GetFirstName]'s supporters have made sure to let this fact be known far and wide, and are no longer pledging fealty to their former liege.\n\nIf I wish to break away from [actor.GetFirstName], now is the time..."
 lawless_succession.0022.a:0 "Pathetic! I'm better off on my own."
 lawless_succession.0022.b:0 "I have no reason to leave [recipient.GetFirstName]'s service."
