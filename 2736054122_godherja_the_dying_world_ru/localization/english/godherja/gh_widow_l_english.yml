gh_widow.1.desc:0 "I am dead and gone, lost to the dark. My spouse will suffer for this."
gh_widow.1.a:0 "You shouldn't be seeing this."

gh_widow.2.t:0 "The Night is Passing"
gh_widow.2.desc:0 "It has been so very long since my beloved was taken from me. So long, in fact, that it does not hurt as much as it once did to think of loving again. The world is not so dark anymore. They are gone, and there is no changing that. Perhaps it is time to move on."
gh_widow.2.a:0 "Yes, yes it is time."
