After all, it's a holy site more than it is a fortress. \nI reach the top to witness a lot of agitation. The gravewards are at work to make this place a true holding by maning the fort, making barricades and advising plans in small commitees. I quickly join my fellow graverights in what looks like a chapel at the center of the construction. All are dedicated to make this fortress the last line of defense of our history to Death itself. The participation of all the faithful is required to store our memories in anyway possible. This is a testament to our survival. Passing down a hive-like corridor of the building I see a room of people frenetically writing some tale passed down in their family and file it in a packed library, then a collective painting of the lost palace of the Enlightency of Vrawsyl. \nFinally, I find a group of nobles trying to pin point their glorious lineage in a complex web of family trees. My stay is spent arguing in length about eachother's prestige until I realize an obscure baron has been going at it for months and would not give up. My title is revealed but none of these Chevalien rights are legitimate to the council of imaginary royals; by sunrise I would be on the road to my lands."

 gh_pilgrimage.0318.desc.graveward:0 "The way to the mass grave of Sacreinux is a notoriously dreadful path of dirt colored by a gloomy light, in the best of days, and facing directly North to the Lichdoms. The barren plains it crosses are strangely oppresive, as if something is amiss, and allow the pilgrims to have a peak at the border on the horizon. I am welcomed by two priests asking for a donation, one of Graveright confession and the other of Graveward confession. Both want to finance their congregation and respectively maintain or reform our faith. I naturally support the Graveward followers as I also think we deserve survival, no matter what. \nAs I make my way in the cemetery, I cross a series of concentric circles made of tombs and reach the center. A statue of an Oejyniczan woman crying, her arms opened toward the ground, dominates a wide square. Of course, all of these tombs are empty; the 'ritual' is nothing but a commemoration of our old ways. Believers are repeating prayers in front of a slab of slate written in our original language, which most of them can not read, decorated with skulls and bones. \nA revulsing thought crosses my mind. Is that what our tradition has come to ? Playing pretend in front of false relics and obsolete rituals ? Pretend that our people were not butchered by these very practices ? These tombs should be opened and visibly empty. What we should grieve is the past. \nI nod in disapproval and join my fellow Gravewards in an alley on the outer circle. "

A greyish grass covers an endless succession of plains and hills which I've been traversing for days. After a while I join a paved road leading to a massive market. All the shopfronts are brimming with enormous apples - the infamous Blood Apples. \nBut more than their size, it's their color and origin which makes their renown, as the name itself suggests. The intense red of their skin gives me a headache just by looking at a full basket for too long. It seems to spill over onto nearby objects, like infectious magic. Then there is the stream of the Tillyes valley, in which flows a strange liquid. The locals say that during dry episodes, it becomes almost milky in aspect. One can drink it, cook with it, though it has a somewhat pungent taste but thankfully no smell. Knowing the river originates from the land of the dead, one can wonder what substance this is. \nStill, Graverights as well as Gravewards come together in enjoying the fruits of the admittedly queer local orchard. Many pilgrims are pressed against the various shops, try to get their hands on the best fruits there are and exchange them. I buy two of them as a souvenir and take the way home."

Unfortunately, a compromise has been made between radical defense and easy of access some pilgrims put holds in the stone for future visitors, whether they are pilgrims or invaders. After all, it's a fortress more than a holy site, isn't it ? \nMy ascension band is split in two on our arrival The graverights are avoiding the busy gravewards as they rush into the chapell, a maze-like museum of oral and written memories from Oejyncza. The others, including me, have no interest in working the past. A dense crowd of gravewards is agitating to the left of the entrance. They are gathered around a wooden sign on which many tasks are written. Apparently, the church needs new types of defenses against the armies of the Lichdoms, and my interest quickly falls onto advising an escape plan from the holding. \nA dozen lords such as myself are working on it and decide it has to be a one-way only so there is no chance of anyone getting into the fort using it. \nMany ideas are thrown around and although I try hard to leave my mark on the project, my idea is noted, and quickly discarded. I stay for a few days to help in menial tasks and leave, knowing the defense is in good hands."

Below sits an expanse of grass, where the holy games themselves take place, and I see the field is even now packed with many eager participants, stretching and training for the evening's games. Here the sport of choice is the art of disc throwing, in imitation of the holy messenger stones the gods place into Kasiryat's mouth. If I should choose to join them then I may have a chance to win glory under the eyes of the Heavens.

Alas, centuries of looting and periodic repression by the Aversarians have seen its beautiful mosaics and breathtaking statuary desecrated and stolen. Nevertheless, enough of the structure remains standing to serve its religious function - an arena for chariot racing. Perhaps I should go join the priests and wise men in the stands, and save myself from death or dismemberment - none of our games are more fatal than those which take place here.

The only signs betraying that there was once a temple built here are a handful of stones poking from the mud and a pair of lonely arches emerging from the apex of the hill.\n\nHere we practice the sport of running, and it is expected for a participant to run a circuit around the vast and wide hill, with the audience resting on the grass to watch. Given that the sports occur during the flood season, the ground which they are expected to run is already muddy and treacherous, and the participants have retired to the hill itself to stretch and prepare.

The great ziggurats have been built up year after year by the efforts of the faithful and the prayers of the priests, and the greatest of them now stands at a height of four tiers, almost entirely engulfing the island upon which it was built\n\nThe Games we carry out here are javelin throwing, in mimicry of the feats of the great king Kulanur when he slew the dragon-tyrant Kybrides in time out of memory. Pilgrims come from afar to reenact this act of heroism every year, throwing our spears against a great jeweled mosaic of the fire breathing abomination to remind the gods of our worthiness.

It is said to be particularly sacred during the aftermath of the flood seasons, and those lucky enough to visit at this time are treated to witness the trickle of festival candles lit by the faithful dwelling upstream.\n\nHere is practiced the oddest of our games which we undertake to impress the gods - the game of theater. While in other places the art of theater is used for profane and downright pornographic entertainments, here in the great amphitheater of the Sainhad we practice it in its purest form. Divine comedies which have been passed down from the distant past are performed here, with the cast largely made up of pilgrims. Should I join them?

A surprisingly humble ziggurat overlooks the lake and the field where the faithful engage in unarmed combat in the sight of the gods. It is said that the summit is home to an oracle who must never be seen by those not of the priestly class, lest Kuthanagi be roused to wrath and wipe mankind from the face of the earth at the command of the gods. Exactly why this is the case is not for mortals to guess.\n\nHere in a bowl-like depression the faithful wrestle, with the victors pinning the losers against the ground. While no weapons, gloves, or clothes are allowed, few other rules are enforced, and eye-gouging or even the dislocation of limbs is often practiced by more ruthless opponents. Betting is common among the spectators who crouch along the flanks of the lowest tier of the ziggurat, observing the sport below.
