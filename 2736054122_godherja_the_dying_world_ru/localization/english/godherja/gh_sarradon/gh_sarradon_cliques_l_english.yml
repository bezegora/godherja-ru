 magi_clique_desc:0 "The [magi|E] represent the magically gifted members of society, consisting broadly of those [magi|E] who perform important functions within the realm. Though not necessarily magical supremacists, they certainly advocate for advancing the roles of [magi|E] in society, pushing for all sorts of benefits for those born with the gift. Their power is, of course, inherent, though it is commonly realized that using force will often be counterproductive. Actions such as reducing sacrificial restrictions, pushing for magical education, and investing into magical research will likely draw their praise."
 warrior_clique_name:0 "Warriors"
 warrior_clique_desc:0 "The warriors are the core of the realm's combat abilities, with a membership ranging from generals and commanders to career soldiers and commonly-employed mercenaries. Not necessarily in favor of constant warfare, they generally hold that their services are necessary for the realm, and that funding and resources should be devoted to armed conflict. Their strength resides in the loyal forces they can draw upon, which they might not shy away from using to strongarm their opposition if the need arises. Any moves that strengthen their hold on power, such as conquest, levying, and increased pay, will have their eager support."
 aristocrat_clique_name:0 "Aristocrats"
 aristocrat_clique_desc:0 "Representing the interests of the landed gentry, nobles can be found across Aeras. In most societies they make up the strongest power bloc, and even in those societies where they do not hold power they are still a force to be reckoned with. They support the exclusivity of noble titles, the pursuit of their own rights and privileges at the expense of the commoners and the merchants, and the expansion of their lands."
 commoner_clique_name:0 "Populists"
 commoner_clique_desc:0 "A fairly loose clique representing the combined interests of society's lower classes, namely peasant smallholders and urban and rural artisans. While generally not among the most wretched of society, their middling status means their interests are often sidelined in favor of the landowners and the urban mercantile classes. Perhaps the only advantage they have is in their sheer numbers, in which they alone outweigh all other cliques. The commoners — and those who ostensibly advocate for their interests — are likely to support forms of public welfare such as grain doles, as well as land redistribution. In these goals they may find occasional support from ambitious nobles looking to use the clique as a power base."
 merchant_clique_name:0 "Merchants"
 merchant_clique_desc:0 "Representing the interests of the urban mercantile classes, the merchant clique stand opposed to the rigid class-based prejudice of the nobility. They also hold themselves above the parochial mindset of the commoners, despite the fact that many among the Merchants have their origins within that class. They tend to support autonomy for urban areas, proposals which support their commercial ambitions, and are eager for the distribution of noble titles in order to improve their place in society further."

 theocrat_clique_desc:0 "Representing the interests of the clergy, theocrats are an influential force across most of Aeras. Though rarely the direct rulers of a realm, the clergy often serve as a key institution in its maintenance, and their unique role in understanding the divine lends them great strength. They tend to support the power of religious institutions, the expansion of the faith, and will often serve as a strong base for a particularly pious ruler."

A faction of the order that originally arose shortly after the execution of their patron saint, the Sanguine were dedicated to expressing their grief following Sansia's death in the shedding of their own blood, which eventually took on more sinister undertones. Over time, the Sanguine came to believe that their intense grief could not be sated by their own blood alone, but that the blood of others must also be shed to express their anguish for Sansia. Renowned for their seeming death wish in battle, the Sanguine are completely without fear and retreat for the sole purpose of preserving their chance to cause more carnage in their next battle.\n\nThey are also known for their disreputable use of weapons specially designed to exsanguinate their victims. Rebellious villages punished for their defiant nature by the Sanguine often play host to gruesome scenes, entire families skinned and hung so as to extract as much blood as possible from their corpses, livestock and pets of the deceased being carved into pieces and the streets awash in blood from the slaughter. Saint Sansia is gone from this world, and only by spilling the blood of every single last one of the unrepentant masses on Aeras can she be avenged."

Shortly after their patron saint's unjust death at the hands of Phancis, they were among the first to worship her as a reincarnation of the Purest. Despite their prior reputation as exemplars who were beholden to Sansia's principles of justice and compassion, they now glory in their wanton cruelty and sadism which goes unmatched throughout all of Sarradon.\n\nEmerging as a coherent group only a few years after the initial landing of the Saintly Orders in Sarradon, the Rosebloods have long been one of the pillars of Sansianite rule in the region. The Rosebloods uphold the order's control over the natives by utilizing their mastery over blood magic to animate legions of blood thralls that compensate for their relative lack of knights. To add to the horror of this practice, carcasses employed in this are predominantly those fallen in past rebellions against Agionist rule in the region, signifying the eventual fate of all those who oppose the order's control. These blood thralls are also commonly used in macabre puppet shows put on by the Rosebloods following uprisings to intimidate the populace into further submission. A symbol of Sansianite repression, the Rosebloods encapsulate the sheer inhumanity present within the order."

As their rejection of luxuries allows them to spend their time honing both their minds and bodies though martial and magical training, the Rosebloods are respected as some of the most martially capable magi in Sarradon, though their rejection of the darker arts of Blood Magic have lead to many traditional Aversarian magi underestimating them as weak-minded fools."

Descended from those soldiers personally chosen by Saint Sansia herself to act as both her shield and spear, the Order of the Rose were always the first into the breach, both feared and loved for unbreaking discipline in battle and magnanimity towards the fallen.\n\nHowever, over the order's time in Sarradon, they have slowly diminished in influence due to their specialty being largely in guarding notables and garrisoning important fortresses, with the Sanguine thereafter supplanting the Order of the Rose and directing the military wing of the Sansianites towards conquest of foreign lands. They decry the savagery and barbarism their fellows have visited upon the native Sarradonians and have espoused the principles of mercy, temperance, and empathy in all things, which have resulted in them being scorned and abhorred by the rest of the order. The more inflammatory among them have said that the Sanguine and the Rosebloods are dishonourable, amoral and have strayed from the teachings of Saint Sansia in their brutality. These firebrands have often found themselves subsequently being put to death as a consequence on charges of sacrilege and treason, with one denied burial and turned into a blood thrall for giving arms and training to the natives to aid them in resisting the order. Many purges were carried out against this faction afterwards, bringing them to the brink of destruction.

Firm believers in the principles of mercy, temperance and empathy, the Order of the Rose will attempt to rehabiliate all but the most wicked of their enemies, whether they be bandits or hostile heathens, and often attempt to initially defuse conflict by way of words rather than force, though when confronted with heinous abuses of the innocent they show no hesitation in risking their own lives in battle."

 metakas_desc:0 "The Cleansers of the Impure or 'Metakas' make up the more militaristic side of the order, being founded relatively recently by knights of the order who believed that impurity could only be removed by means of great cleansings. Dedicated to the purification of the lands the order governs, the Cleansers take to their work with zeal, and are dreaded across Sarradon as butchers and vile murderers of the innocent and helpless. Unfazed by this outpouring of hatred from those they consider to be worth little more than animals, the Cleansers refuse to spare any of the impure, fearing that they may defile the land and corrupt the pure. If they deem it necessary, the Cleansers have even been known to tear away suckling babes from their mothers as their mothers beg and plead for mercy before slaughtering them with nay a hint of remorse, glee spreading across their typically stern faces as they cleanse another source of potential corruption from Sarradon."

Often driven both a the desire to see the world as well a religious duty to protect their brethren, many Kastemas are quite interested in philosophy and theology and enjoy hearing and learning about local beliefs and ideas. Some Kastema may even choose to guard non-Agionist preachers or philosophers whose teachings resonate with the those of Katharitos, as true purity comes not from professing to follow the Saints but from the Love within one's heart."

Typically, the Inspectors regularly travel around the order's lands to closely examine the denizens living therein for signs of impurity. Those found to be bearing signs of impurity by the Inspectors are recorded in their lists, meticulously kept and maintained in the finest condition so that none of the impure may escape their just punishment to be meted out by one of the Cleansers. Additionally, the Inspectors are charged with the task of finding suitable breeding arrangements for the populace so as to best maintain purity within the order, and keeping track of the fruits of these couplings, having the purest of the pure pressed into the order itself."

 epichorima_pure_desc:0 "The Seekers of Purity or 'Epirina' are a faction descending from both Aversarian cults of Katharitos attempting to reconcile his teachings with traditional Aagiokratian beliefs, as well as followers of Katharitos seeking to moderate the excesses of Aversaria by making Katharites ideas more palatable to adapt. Like Katharitos, they regard purity as coming from having an open mind and soul, but unlike most Katharites, they believe that Aversarians have an easier time attaining the state of purity than other, more impure peoples. This prospensivity for purity is not inborn, however, but primarily result of the Aversarians advanced culture - thus, Aversarians should not enslave other, lesser peoples, but rather teach them the knowledge of Katharitos and the Purest so that they too may attain the same state of purity as the Aversarians. Though the Epirima tend to profess more extreme beliefs in front of possible Aversarian converts than they do inside the order itself, they are still viewed as quite heterodox, and while generally somewhat accepted due to the pluralism within Katharicism, some see their beliefs as a dangerous corruption of Katharitos' teachings."

Rumored to hold the authentic versions of the texts of Katharitos, works deemed heretical by the rest of the order in favor of the now orthodox editions, the Puresages are by and large ostracized by their fellow brethren for various reasons. Foremost among them is their tendency to console the impure condemned to death by the Inspectors, earning them a great deal of disgust from the Cleansers, who hold such compassion for the inhuman as unbefitting for one of the pure. This and other actions deemed as blasphemy by the order has had several Puresages being declared among the impure by Inspectors and subsequently executed by the Cleansers in numerous past crackdowns."

Even when not traveling, they still use much of their time discussing and sharing their experiences with each other, though they also spend a good amount of time in their order medidating on their travels and on Katharitos' teachings. The Sages' Katharite beliefs are thus often quite eclectic, incorporating both various beliefs they have stumbled upon duing their own travels as well as those transmitted from other Katharites."

Employing beatings, continual harassment, torture and numerous other methods to terrorize the populace, the Collectors ensure that not only will the people contribute properly to their required alms, they additionally guarantee that any hint of rebellion is to be swiftly followed with exceedingly disproportionate retribution, thereby maintaining the peace within their lands."

Surely, without such a great and imposing palace they could not possibly hope to accommodate the many beggars requiring alms (who have been barred from the palace since its construction). Nor could they store their numerous entirely 'freely' donated alms securely without vaults that are among the world's largest. And if they did not collect all these alms, how could they possibly grant any to the needy? Naturally, the Distributors have nearly always awarded gathered alms to the brethren of the order, with the rare exception being one occurrence where alms were rendered to one of the animals under their care instead. Moreover, they insist that their ceaseless and ostentatious feasts are but an expression of their thanks for the many donations given to them completely willingly by the populace of their lands due to their abject destitution. Ultimately, without the Distributors' exceedingly conscientious granting of alms to the deprived, the order might not have been able to afford two hundred new chambers made up entirely of pearls with beds of silk and filled with courtesans for the monks of the order, which would have certainly been a tragedy."

Furthermore, the Givers are prone to acts of generosity and some have even been known to melt down their own knightly armor into farm tools to aid peasants often suffering from the relentless confiscations of possessions by monks of the order.

Among the eldest branches of Thysia’s Order Militant, they are chiefly made up of women with only a few men included within their ranks. Furthermore, they have heretofore managed to avoid falling into the trap of progress by any means necessary due to their identity as healers who do not discriminate and the nature of their work giving them few opportunities to conduct research.

In times of plague, however, the Hospitalliers can always be counted on to congregate where the illness is worst, doing their best to slow down the spread of sickness and death.

Many of those who come seeking a sort of salve for their many ills are of little means, unable to scrounge up the few coins needed to pay for the treatment they need oh so much. Fortunately for them, however, the Syngamar are quite happy to draw up contracts involving alternative means of payment… even if said persons are illiterate and utterly unable to understand what they are agreeing to. These contracts often have stipulations that most would consider completely absurd, with the order being freed from any liability regarding accidental deaths and given total ownership over one’s cadaver.

And of course, the Thysian creed does not allow them to turn down those in need, though they too will pay a price all the same. \n\nThese duties however, do not distract them from their equally important charge of defending the order, and more importantly procuring heathens for use in the order’s crusade against death itself. Many a peasant rebellion has found itself elated at the capture of a minor fortress only to meet a sudden end when their entire encampment erupts into a massive pillar of flame. Of course, those still left among the living are quickly captured and given the best medical treatments known to man, being kept alive even as they scream to be granted the mercy of death, their flesh charred to the bone and limbs hanging on by mere threads. Of course, the Menders do not oblige them, as no doctor could ethically allow their patients to die without first doing everything in their power to save them, especially when studying their broken bodies would allow the order to advance further in its quest for life.

It is also they who do much of the basic infastructural upkeep to ensure mortality rates are kept at a level where the population of enslaved is at least nominally sustainable. This has led them to butting heads with the Masters and the Securers alike on many occasions, as the other two often fail to see why a clearly disposable resource should be fussed with in this manner."
 benedictioners_pure_name:0 "Logisa"
 benedictioners_pure_desc:0 "A spiritually minded group of Calystianites, the Benedictors or 'Logisa' are tasked with spreading the teachings of Saint Calysto as well as caring for the freed or escaped slaves who find themselves under the protection of the order. It is the Benedictors who are responsible for finding the former slaves are place where they can live, be it in the order's lands or elsehwere, as well as teach them the skills necessary to prosper in their new freedom. The Benedictors also serve as the ideological core of the order, writing diatrebes and pamphlets condemning the enslavement of others, and can also be found wandering outside the order's territory preaching about the evils of slavery. Their wanderings also serve the dual purpose of finding communities sympathetic to the Calystianite cause, and which are willing to take in slaves freed by the Calystianites."
 patrons_name:0 "Atrikoi"
 patrons_desc:0 "The Patrons or 'Atrikoi' is a general term for the various honorary Calystianite lodges and fraternities one may join by providing the order with a generous donation. Patrons are generally not motivated to join by zeal, but rather to gain access to Calystianite trade connections, which are unrivaled in the slave trade. The fact that the Patrons' ships tend to be much less likely to fall prey to piracy or other 'accidents' at sea is another popular boon of the status. The group consists of merchants and aristocrats from all over Aeras, the vast majority of whom have no actual belief in the Calystianite creed, slowly expanding the order's network of commercial and political connections as they work to increase their own wealth and power. Though most Patrons have no official duties, their wealth and influence means they hold much sway within the order, with many commands and high-ranking positions being given to wealthy Patrons (who will often delegate the actual duties involved)."
 patrons_pure_name:0 "Atrikoi"
 patrons_pure_desc:0 "The Patrons or 'Atrikoi' is a general term for the mercantile appendage of the order, consisting of both trade-minded Calystianites as well as merchants on good terms with the order. Willing to fund or support mercantile endeavors in exchange for a share of the profit, the Patrons receive not only monetary support but also access to Calystianite maps and knowledge of the sea, as well as the threat of Liberators unleashing brutal reprisals on any pirates who dare attack their ships. The goal of this is not only to gather resources for the order, but also to economically disincentivize slavery, as the Calystianites refuse to do business with any merchants that are known to engage with the slave trade. Should a slave trader gain access to the benefits of Patrons, they would theoretically benefit greatly from their information on the Liberators' activities, though surely no honest Calystianite or merchant would provide them with such information..."

 suntrofoi_desc:0 "The Companions or 'Suntrofoi'. Descendants of the men and women who stood by Saint Eiosos' side, the Suntrofoi have fought and lived together for generations, passing the memory of their founder from parent to child. They are both the spiritual and military heart of the Order of the Forlorn Guardian, and the rigorous practice of training their children from birth has provided the order with some of its greatest fighters and leaders. Their close-knit bonds and insular nature has resulted in the Order of the Forlorn Guardian being regarded as the most conservative and insular of the Agionist orders, and this isolation has resulted in the alliances with their coreligionists decaying to a possibly catastrophic degree. \n\nUnfortunately the Suntrofoi families are finite in number, and recent losses in the Saint's Crusade has pushed the clique to the brink of a crisis."
 thousandspears_name:0 "Strayades"
 thousandspears_desc:0 "A faction composed largely of Eosians who came to the order from outside the Suntrofoi families, the Chapter of the Thousand Spears or 'Strayades' has functioned virtually as second class members of the Order of the Forlorn Guardian for some time. While never afforded the same privileges and funds as their aloof leaders, they have benefited from closer relationships with the other Agionist orders who find them easier to deal with. Their fighting style has also diverged, eschewing some of the principles of strict discipline and honor codes enforced by the Suntrofoi and towards more pragmatic approaches to tactics and rulership alike. The old guard grumble of a soft coup taking place, but may be powerless to stop it..."
 gaithos_name:0 "Gaithos"
 gaithos_desc:0 "The Riders of Saint Eos or ‘Gaithos’ are famed for their chivalrous attitudes and valor that surpasses even that of the Suntrofoi, though they are also hated by many due to the bulk of their membership being of partial native descent. They uphold the tradition of Saint Eos with great fervor, protecting and aiding the weak wherever they may go, and accepting no reward other than the warm gratitude of those they save from any number of troubles. Due to their familiarity with native culture and practices, the order often calls upon them to serve as intermediaries between them and the natives. This has given birth to a harmony that is especially rare in the lands ruled by the Agionists, and furthermore has contributed to a state of relative tranquility within the fiefs of the order, forming a stark contrast to the constant cycle of death and pain perpetuated by the other orders. The saint beckons, and his riders answer."

As their focus is more on stability than on expansion, they attempt to curb overextension, instead focusing on holding a tight grip over the currently-held territories of the Order.

Once some of the wealthiest cabals of the north of the continent, their fortunes were left in ashes after the collapse of colonial authority in the [gh_agionists_faghira_jalil_revolt|E] of the 1220s and the emergence of Kekhenemhat in the 1240s.\n\nNow destitute and nearly landless, they've been attempting to retake their lost fortunes ever since - with decidedly mixed results."

 raadilist_name:0 "Raadilists"
 raadilist_desc:0 "The Councilists (or Raadilists) are one of the main two political parties of the Kanzelerij's nobility. The Councilists descend from the regency council of Konen Hayrdweng, who was born comatose and remained so until his death. A regency council took effective control, and formed a cohesive faction when Hayrdweng's successor, Causen, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the council or open the doors of his palace to them. In response, the council began nailing legislation on the door of the palace in Causen's name, any attempt by the king to undo their legislation ignored.\n\nThe councilists were removed from power in the Popular Revolution of 1099, but the party's descendants have continued to vie for a return to noble power since, many even dreaming of a restoration of the monarchy to give themselves a popular puppet. While ostensibly a faction of the nobility, they are primarily separated from the Unitarians not by noble blood but of the power of their lands, representing the political desires of the more powerful or entrenched land owners."
 unitarish_name:0 "Unitarish"
 unitarish_desc:0 "The Unitarians (or Unitarish, or People of Unity), one of the main two political parties of the Kanzelerij's nobility. They are named after the opening words in Kanzeleren Bruden's declaration of his new state in 1099, which were "We (the new ruling council) are the people of unity". After deposing what had become seen as an incompetent and corrupt regency council that had held complete control of the country for nearly 150 years, the Unitarians established an ostenible republic. One where only the landed may vote, and the chancellor serves for life. By all accounts, the Popular Revolution was less a revolution and more the minor nobility taking power away from the larger estate holders who controlled the regency council.\n\nThe Unitarians remain popular among the lower classes and many nobles alike, and the faction advocates for a continuation of the 'republican' system. Despite their rhetoric, however, they remain a clique of entrenched nobles and rich merchants, separated from their opponents (primarily the Councilists) by their desire to further the power of the less individually powerful but more numerous low-nobility."
 neutrals_name:0 "Neutrals"
 neutrals_desc:0 "Neutrals, as defined by the Konijkmener political system, is a catch-all term for all parties (and their members) not aligned with the leading Unitarians or Councilists. Like their rival factions, they are actually dozens of various parties aligned towards one goal, primarily the prevention of a dead-lock on power by the two main factions in the realm. Neutrals are generally looked down upon by many Konijkmener as indecisive and disparate with little actual common goals or desires beyond a dislike of the major parties, but nonetheless normally represent a full third of the government's political actors and still enjoy widespread popular support. The biggest benefactor of the Neutrals tends to be those of the merchant class who find themselves unable to own land or at least enough to achieve real power in the two major factions, instead joining into minor leagues and parties with a desire to further the goals of general commerce and mercantilism for their own benefit."
 
 gisredde_banks_name:0 "The Bankers"
 gisredde_banks_desc:0 "Representatives of Peti Gisredde's long-entrenched lenders, the bankers are a key part of the city's mercantile ecosystem, and as this network has spread to encompass increasingly large parts of Aeras, so too have expanded the invisble threads of influence of the city's bank. They are primarily interested in ensuring the constant flow of debts and and interest payments continue, and with maintaining an iron grip upon the city's money supply. In fact, should this balance slip, a crisis of untold proportions would likely emerge, both for the Gisreddes and for Chevelie as a whole."
 
 gisredde_artisans_name:0 "The Artisans"
 gisredde_artisans_desc:0 "Representing the combined interests of the city's guilds and experienced tradespeople, the artisans are a diverse clique whose membership ranges from the Path Blessed Guild of Gisreddean Shoemakers to the Esteemed Brotherhood of Brewers and Vintners, and even include the Sisters and Brothers of the Rose - the city's remarkably influential courtesans guild. United mostly by their need to ensure a steady flow of raw materials and patrons, they will tend to support any policy which ensures access to both. Conversely they will be highly resistant to policies which could break their stranglehold on finished goods. As the common people are usually associated in some way with these artisans, they are represented within this clique as well."

 gisredde_companies_name:0 "The Knightly Companies"
 gisredde_companies_desc:0 "Peti Gisredde is more than an emporium for mundane goods, it also serves as the base of operations for Marcher mercenary companies operating across Aeras. Primarily centered around a street known as the Bastard's Run, the Mercenaries are represented by a dizzying array of gaudy, eye-catching, and largely arbitrarily constructed heraldry plastered onto nearly every available surface in their self-proclaimed home district, where they base themselves alongside a similarly aligned series of less greedy (self-proclaimed) knightly chapters. The Companies are largely interested in securing access to war - preferably those far from Peti Gisredde, but they're hardly picky. Business is business after all"

 gisredde_aristocracy_name:0 "The Aristocracy"
 gisredde_aristocracy_desc:0 "Though commonly considered a merchant city, the nobles of Peti Gisredde play a critical role in the city's nominal governance, constantly attempting to defend their privileges against the dirty, lazy, useless malcontents of the lower classes that are coming to take everything they have worked hard (read: being born) to earn, be they successful merchants, legendary knights, or faithful clergymen. Their political faction is headed by a handful of ancient - and powerful - houses, who together decry the long-standing scourge of dreaded 'meritocracy' in Peti Gisredde, arguing that the city must rely on the tried and true bonds of aristocratic blood right. They will lend their support to any actions that will aid them in this goal, and they will hold their noses and work with even the blighted plebeians if they think it will benefit them." 
 gisredde_cartels_name:0 "The Cartels"
 gisredde_cartels_desc:0 "Pillars of their community and a vital organ through which the rushing blood of the city feeds its beating heart, the cartels hold themselves as some of Peti Gisredde's oldest and most respected guilds and organizations, with long and storied histories of community service, political participation, and the occasional gang wars. A city with over ninety registered thieve's guilds, assassins charters, crime syndicates, the Oejeynican Crime Concordat, and countless unregistered organizations (and perhaps worst of all, banks), Peti Gisredde has long responded to excessively high crime rates by performing the 'Gisreddean miracle' and taxing the hell out of them. While many consider the fact that the average pickpocket or beggar holding aspirations for political office is a societal failing, they nevertheless represent one of the city's most powerful interest groups and hold great sway in its management. And as many a mother has said of their wayward child, "At least they didn't join the City Watch.""

 gisredde_theocrats_desc:0 "Technically a branch of the Conclave of Raocourt, Gisredde's Conclave controls everything from back-alley chapels to the (oft literally) warring cathedrals. Despite being Chevalie's most powerful regional conclave, Raocourt openly despises them more than any Magi Cabal or Stavroist cult, largely because the Gisreddean Church is, generously, the world's pettiest organization and with absurd frequency answers every 'violation' of 'rights' (total independence) with great schism.\n\nThese schisms (and following Chevalie-wide riots) come with alarming regularity. Such as after Raocourt's 599 IS attempt to account for leap years with minor calendar reform; 654 IS when chastened for exchanging Waysainthood for money and/or sex; or the 789 IS rejection of local Waymother Isaia's self-declared Living Sainthood because of her 37 (public) Assassin's Guild contracts and unconcealed embezzlement of church funds to build what she proudly called, 'a sex castle', in the pleasure district.\n\nGreatest of all was 857 IS, when drunk Peti Gisreddean mercenaries exhumed Grande Gisreddean Waysaint Ivre and took the corpse brothel-hopping. Grande Gisreddeans then did likewise to Peti Gisreddean Waysaint Âne, but knocked over a lantern and incinerated Âne's cathedral and forty sacred icons and artifacts. Raocourt promptly excommunicated all Gisreddeans (including all past and future ones), which was technically never rescinded and remains de jure. An insanely petty and insubordinate collective of influencers, they're naturally seen as exemplar's of Gisreddean culture, and represent all local believers (excluding registered and taxed foreign faiths, shadowy cults, and banks claiming religious status for tax reasons)."
