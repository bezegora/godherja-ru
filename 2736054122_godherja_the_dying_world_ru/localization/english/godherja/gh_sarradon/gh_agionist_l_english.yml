 agionist.0011.title:0 "The Final Arrival"
 agionist.0011.desc:0 "As Phaedre passes me and enters the procession, the final member of the ceremony arrives.\n\nThe Grandmaster of the Order of the Forgotten Saint, entering the room followed by a lock-step and identical group of retainers and a biting chill despite the desert warmth. Their mask is blank, even their eyes hardly visible, and I realize I know nothing of this... man? As is their nature, whoever they once were, they took the name Anomachis upon ascension. Nameless One.\n\nI manage to force out my greeting, as is customary, but they stop and turn slowly as their procession marches in without a word. It is as if I am watching the movement of a Katharaddi automata, not a living being but a creature of magic and clockwork clicking away to a tune."
 agionist.0011.a:0 "And then they speak to me."
 
 agionist.0012.title:0 "The Ordermaster Speaks"
 agionist.0012.desc:0 ""[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]," they say in a tone that seems more reminiscent to a spider weaving silk than that of any human, "I am... eager to finally speak with you... truly, we are. We have watched your rise carefully... a most irregular one, one that you and I both know that we did not intend."\n\n"Ordermaster Pasthon was not one for regularity," I manage out, despite an odd tightening in my throat. I am only just now realizing I have no recollection of what Anomachis sounds like, as if the memory had been stolen from my mind as soon as it had been written there. I imagine a woman's voice, a mans, a thousand at once and one booming singularly. Is this just my imagination? Am I going mad?\n\n"Indeed... truly... yes..." Anomachis drones, like I was a soldier who had just stepped out of formation, "Your ceremony... we see it is as it has been, as it always shall be. I've seen many... I would like to speak to you... after. A conversation in private. A tradition, held among all of the... prestigious who are named Ordermaster."\n\nExactly as Pasthon had warned... the time for decision as now. Trust the ramblings of my mad old mentor and no doubt anger the most powerful of all the Orders, or follow in the path of the others?"
