 refound_east_mamur_decision:0 "Refound the Eastern Mamuramat"
 refound_east_mamur_decision_desc:0 "Vacant since the violent death of al-Hudi in 802 IS, the Eastern Mamuramat was at one time a second, competing hub for Wardenite civilization. Its court at al-Qais was home to a vibrant cultural and legal tradition. Now, with our dominant position in the east we can restore the dignity of this once great land. Of course, doing so will certainly provoke conflict with the Central Mamur who illegally holds the title, but we can deal with him in time."
 refound_east_mamur_decision_tooltip:0 "Proclaim the restoration of the Eastern Mamuramat, equivalent in dignity and authority to the line of Tathtali."
 refound_east_mamur_decision_confirm:0 "Become the East Mamur"
 refound_west_mamur_decision:0 "Refound the Western Mamuramat"
 refound_west_mamur_decision_desc:0 "Vacated since the collapse of the ruling House of Qassi in 678 IS and the subsequently permanent assumption of regency by the Central Mamur in 682 IS, the Western Mamur was the first to dissapear as an independant force in Wardenism. Now, after centuries of injustice, we stand prepared to reestablish it once more. Doing this will inevitably put us into conflict with the Central Mamur who holds the title as his birthright, but we are no cowards!"
 refound_west_mamur_decision_tooltip:0 "Restore the Western Mamuramat, bulwark against the Hiklahn!"
 refound_west_mamur_decision_confirm:0 "Become the West Mamur"
 refound_far_east_mamur_decision:0 "Refound the Far Eastern Mamuramat"
 refound_far_east_mamur_decision_desc:0 "Though never much liked by its three supposed peers, the Far Eastern Mamur was no less legitimate than they. Usun Bishabelik's mission was a holy one undertaken at the request of the First Warden himself, and claims to the contrary are naught but slander and lies from those who refused to recognize his conversion. Now it is time for us to retake his legacy. Let us push the borders of the faith to distant Kasharya itself, and perhaps even beyond!"
 refound_far_east_mamur_decision_tooltip:0 "Proclaim the Far Eastern Mamuramat and realize Bishabelik's ambitions."
 refound_far_east_mamur_decision_confirm:0 "Forward, til we meet the rising sun itself!"
 found_southern_mamur_decision:0 "Found the Southern Mamuramat"
 found_southern_mamur_decision_desc:0 "For the first time in history, the formerly heathen lands of Damota have been subdued. To maintain control of this southern realm, where once infidels plotted to raise the Dead God, it is time that a new Mamuramat be declared, to insure that these conquests will never slip from our grasps. What the rest of the faith will think of such a proclamation, however, is yet to be seen."
 found_southern_mamur_decision_tooltip:0 "Found the Southern Mamuramat, to forevermore guard the southern edge of the faith!"
 found_southern_mamur_decision_confirm:0 "Become the Southern Mamur"
 found_far_western_mamur_decision:0 "Found the Far Western Mamuramat"
 found_far_western_mamur_decision_desc:0 "The great dream of Wardenites — besides defeating the heretic Ritualists — has long been to see the west brought into the fold of faith. While the first great effort was halted by the betrayal of the Ayyar, their later conversion and redemption finally set our path right anew. Now, the west is finally united by the First Warden's followers, and it is time for a new figure to step forth and lead them! Whether the rest of Sarradon appreciate the arrival of a new mamur is yet to be seen, however..."
 found_far_western_mamur_decision_tooltip:0 "Found the Far Western Mamuramat, and bring law to the sunset realm!"
 found_far_western_mamur_decision_confirm:0 "Become the Far Western Mamur"
 found_new_mamuramat_decision:0 "Found a New Mamuramat"
 found_new_mamuramat_decision_desc:0 "My realm's expansion across distant shores leaves the Wardenite faithful I rule over in an odd place. Technically our lands are outside the jurisdiction of any of the traditional Mamuramats, and many are starting to whisper that I should follow in the footsteps of the legendary Usun Bishabelik and declare myself a the leader of a new Mamuramat. It would certainly be unprecedented, but so is the very existence of a strong [wardenite|E] realm outside of [sarradon|E]."
 found_new_mamuramat_decision_tooltip:0 "Found a completely new Mamuramat, and bring law to distant shores!"

 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_kotserion_decision:0 "A Triumph in Mukhtab!"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_kotserion_decision_desc:0 "We have driven the Agionists from Mukhtab - or as they called it in their barbarian tongue, "Kotserion". Our ordeal is far from over, and already the slaves to these saints of sin gather on our borders, ready to drive us back. Nevertheless, the entire Wardenite world hails our victory. Our efforts have gone a long way towards restoring the dignity and authority of the Mamur."
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_kotserion_decision_tt:0 "Provlaim your victory over the Agionists in Mukhtab."
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_kotserion_decision_confirm:0 "Let the Afazariani tremble!"

 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_sianna_decision_desc:0 "We have followed up our victory in Mukhtab, driving the Agionists further away from the heartland of the Mamuramat. We are now one step closer to reclaiming the Eastern Island and the site of our faith's birth. Be warned however: while the Wardenite faithful rejoice at our continued momentum, the Agionists are likely consolidating their forces to resist us. We must tread carefully moving forward. On the other hand, we may now attempt to reassert our authority over some of the territories lost to the Mamuramat during our long decline."
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_sianna_decision_tt:0 "Proclaim your victory over the Agionists in Behbarven"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_sianna_decision_confirm:0 "Drive the Afazariani into the sea!"

 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_gahzi_decision:0 "A Triumph in Gahzi!"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_gahzi_decision_desc:0 "The Agionists are in disorder. Our victorious armies have swept through Gahzi, putting any who refuse submission to the sword. Though our struggle has been great, only the dregs of their villainous orders remain to resist us. Let them rattle their sabers and ape bravery, they shall die just like their brothers and sisters in arms."
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_gahzi_decision_tt:0 "Proclaim our victory in gahzi!"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_gahzi_decision_confirm:0 "To the Eastern Isle!"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_gahzi_decision_is_valid:0 "You must own the Kingdom of Gahzi, and ensure no independant Agionists survive in its terrotory, or in the Tifrennesh highlands."

 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_skiadhadhes_decision_desc:0 "The Agionists have nearly been driven from the mainland - Praise be to the First Warden and His Laws! Now only the final push along the coastline remains. Let the masked scum tremble on their stolen island, we shall be there soon enough. In the meantime, this victory has restored the Mamur's authority to the point that we may be able to reassert our authority over our brothers in faith in the east."
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_skiadhadhes_decision_tt:0 "Proclaim our victory over the Agionists in Mohrtag al-Badi"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_skiadhadhes_decision_confirm:0 "The final victory is at hand!"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_skiadhadhes_decision_is_valid:0 "You must own the Kingdom of Mohrtag Al Badi, and ensure no independant Agionists survive in its territory or within the Kingdom of Jamayya."

 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_chegea_decision:0 "A Beachhead on the Eastern Isle"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_chegea_decision_desc:0 "The final reckoning of the Agionists is at hand. The followers of the so called "Forgotten Saint", the last Agionists standing, have tasted our vengeance on the beaches of Dhami. Though there may be years of bitter fighting ahead of us, we have proven that their heathen armies are no match for our virtue and courage. Forward, to the Warden's Prison itself!"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_chegea_decision_tt:0 "Let us begin the final struggle!"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_chegea_decision_confirm:0 "There shall be no place left for them to hide!"

 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_almubid_decision_desc:0 "Never since the days of the Great Uprising has the Wardenite faith seen so great a triumph. Naught but a generation or two ago many Wardenites questioned the sacred rights of the Mamur. But now? From the distant borders of the Amsari in the west to the Crater in the east the faithful sing our praises. Though some Agionists may lurk in various holdouts, their power has been broken forever. Now begins a new golden age for Sarradon. An age of law. An age of Wardenism. An age of the Mamur."
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_almubid_decision_tt:0 "Is our struggle finally at an end?"
 wardenite_mamur_reclaim_almubid_decision_confirm:0 "The Mamur is Triumphant!"

 wardenite_mamur_reassert_authority_kathsiti:0 "Reassert Authority Over the Kathsiti"
 wardenite_mamur_reassert_authority_kathsiti_desc:0 "The loss of the province of Uraghad was, in retrospect, a sign of things to come. The centuries to follow would see the Mamur's authority break down across the Wardenite world, resulting in the sorry state of affairs that led to the Saint's Crusade. However, under our leadership the ship of state appears to have been righted, and those who once denigrated our title as a relic of the past are being made to question their folly. Let us send messengers to the rebellious cities of Uraghad and the Barzawa demanding submission. They will understand the implicit threat..."

 wardenite_mamur_reassert_authority_ayyar:0 "Rule the Ayyar Directly."
 wardenite_mamur_reassert_authority_ayyar_desc:0 "Since their arrival the Ayyar have successfully skirted the line between insubordination and submission. Their unique status came from a clever set of negotiations with the Mamurs who came before us. That our ancestors were unable to secure full submission was a symptom of weakness, which has now been purged from the Mamur. With this in mind, let us remind the Ayyar of the requirements set upon them by their faith. We are sure they will do the right thing."
 wardenite_mamur_reassert_authority_ayyar_tt:0 "If they agree, they shall swear fealty to the Mamur"

It now merely requires one final edict to cement our reforms, to punish those who committed terrible crimes in the Saint's name, before the arduous work of seperating ourselves from our bloodstained actions can begin.
