 building_arena_01:0 "Fighting Rings"

 building_arena_04_desc:0 "Competitors from around the world meet seeking glory and the thrill of victory.

 building_arena_05:0 "Hippodrome"

 building_arena_07:0 "Magitechnical Colosseum"
 building_arena_07_desc:0 "A complex mix of [magic|E] and machinery has been built into this arena, allowing for far more technically impressive fights to happen. The special effects alone would be enough to sell a ticket at high markup, not to mention the truly epic battles that they are meant to enhance."
 building_arena_08:0 "Legendary Arena"
 building_arena_08_desc:0 "The sheer outrageous scale and quality of this arena have made it an almost otherworldly experience to attend. More than a few foreign kings have paid a pretty penny for a good view here. The army of workers, [magi|E] and special machinery keeping the place running have allowed for fights of truly titanic proportions to be organized, and cooperation with local playwrights' guilds means that epic plays can be seamlessly woven in as well.\n\nAmong other things, the arena has hosted multi-day reenactments of the rampage of the [worldeater|E], of the [red_river_war|E], and of course, the [imperial_civil_war|E] - complete with its own mock [frodbrokna|E]!"

 building_type_granary_01:0 "Farmer's Market"

 building_granary_01:0 "Peasants' Stalls"
 building_granary_01_desc:0 "A few farmers from the surrounding hinterland have set up shop here, selling the excess products of their labor. Though these kinds of stalls can generally be found in abundance in every major city, the area seems to have unusual potential, as the sellers are reporting lucrative profits."
 building_granary_02:0 "Bakeries"
 building_granary_02_desc:0 "Though every city and, indeed, even village tends to have a bakery or two, the ubiquitous availability of flour and other staple crops has allowed for a diverse and highly specialized pastry sector to develop, filling the morning air across the area with the pleasant smell of fresh bread and other produce."
 building_granary_03:0 "Butchers' Shops"
 building_granary_03_desc:0 "The widespread availability of meat has allowed for butchers' shops and a diverse meat-processing sector to spring up across the city, allowing even commoners access to affordable poultry, pork and beef."
 building_granary_04:0 "Granaries"
 building_granary_04_desc:0 "Grain flows into this city in such obscene volumes that it requires several massive granaries and silos to store. So cheaply accessible are flour-based products that a bread dole has been instituted, handing out free basic foodstuffs for all the city's poor."
 building_granary_05:0 "Livestock Market"
 building_granary_05_desc:0 "The sheer amount of livestock present in the fertile farmlands around this city allow for it to be sold at truly cheap prices. Though the smell might be rancid, the fact that a head of cattle can be bought for the same price as a tankard of ale does speak much about the overall agricultural prosperity of the region. Foreign merchants have been known to visit the city purely to export the dirt-cheap farm animals sold within."
 building_granary_06:0 "Cheese Industry"
 building_granary_06_desc:0 "It would seem that everyone with access to dairy has their own delicious variety of cheese to peddle. The brilliant riot of colors, textures and tastes would make anyone's mouth water."
 building_granary_07:0 "Specialty Food Market"
 building_granary_07_desc:0 "No longer is this place considered merely a source of cheap food - the local cuisine has begun specializing and becoming refined for finer palates. Several strange types of food have developed here, including a strange, gelatinous confectionery, a round, flat dough topped with various meats and condiments, and chilled cream."
 building_granary_08:0 "Cornucopia"
 building_granary_08_desc:0 "The cuisine of the city, its seemingly endless local varieties of bread, pastry, meat, dairy produce and other, more exotic types of food, is famed across the world. Ordinary foodstuffs have become so cheap that it is no longer profitable to merely sell them directly on their own. Rather, it seems that every single stall in this massive, district-spanning market has some local twist to old dishes and completely unique ones of their own.\n\nThough poverty is a problem as in any other place, at the very least, even the most wretched commoner can likely afford a dinner that would be fit for the banquet of a noble in some less prosperous place."
 
 building_type_brewery_01:0 "Breweries"
 building_type_brewery_01_desc:0 "Where the lifeblood of civilizations pours forth from."
 building_brewery_01:0 "Brewer's Shack"

 building_brewery_02:0 "Winemaker"
 building_brewery_02_desc:0 "A winemaker churns out vintage of an acceptable quality, though most well-to-do citizens of a sensitive palate still thumb their noses at this and prefer imported wine."
 building_brewery_03:0 "Tavern Quarter"
 building_brewery_03_desc:0 "Breweries have sprung up throughout this area, supplying the local taverns all day and night long. About half the town watch is stationed here, as spontaneous brawls seem to erupt like thunder from a storm cloud."
 building_brewery_04:0 "Distillery"
 building_brewery_04_desc:0 "Fine liquor and spirits are made here, much to the delight of locals seeking to find themselves passed out drunk before they can even finish a second drink."
 building_brewery_05:0 "Brewery District"
 building_brewery_05_desc:0 "The concentration of breweries and taverns has increased so much that an entire portion of the district is dedicated solely to producing beer, wine and liquors. The city now outputs enough drink to supply not just itself, but the wider local region."
 building_brewery_06:0 "Beverage Guild"
 building_brewery_06_desc:0 "Local brewers, winemakers and distillers have formed an organized guild to spread their produce far and wide."
 building_brewery_07:0 "Alcohol Manufactories"
 building_brewery_07_desc:0 "The process of churning out absurd amounts of drink has been streamlined even further with both mechanical and magical means. Surely, this should be enough to supply all of our needs?"
 building_brewery_08:0 "World's Drink Drum"
 building_brewery_08_desc:0 "The amount of both swill and fine brew pouring out of this city could feed a river. The beverages made here can be found anywhere from a common drunkard's tankard several kingdoms away, to a high lord's banquet table across the sea."

 building_cemetery_03_desc:0 "A small object of spiritual importance has been erected among the graves that fill this area."
 building_cemetery_04:0 "Garden of Remembrance"
 building_cemetery_04_desc:0 "A garden has sprung up within the graveyard, dedicated to remembering and honoring the dead, and offering visitors a place for peaceful contemplation.\n\nThe daily needs of the cemetery can no longer be fulfilled by volunteers from the community, and a permanent groundskeeper now tends to the site."
 building_cemetery_05:0 "Dense Cemetery"
 building_cemetery_05_desc:0 "The accrued graves, small and large, of countless generations have begun to make surface area a precious commodity here. Some of the oldest areas have likely been built over several times, their original occupants long since forgotten."
 building_cemetery_06:0 "Nobles' Tombs"
 building_cemetery_06_desc:0 "The cemetery has grown well-kept and prestigious enough that some of the more well-off citizens have decided that it is better suited as their final resting place than the garden of the family estate. Tombs of markedly higher quality and full of wealth have begun springing up across the grounds."
 building_cemetery_07:0 "Royal Tombs"
 building_cemetery_07_desc:0 "Prestigious and renowned, this budding necropolis has now been graced by the magnificent mausoleums of several kings and their kin. The amount of wealth interred within has resulted in a full-time cadre of guards, and groundskeepers now likely beyond counting." 
 building_cemetery_08:0 "Necropolis"
 building_cemetery_08_desc:0 "An entire kingdom rests beneath the stones of the stacked mausoleums and tombs that occupy every last space of the cemetery. Regular burial has long since grown exorbitantly expensive enough to prevent all but the richest a normal grave, so urns now seem to exist in every nook and cranny. Meanwhile, the combined tombs and mortuary complexes of entire royal dynasties and thousands of members of the lesser nobility mean that there is a veritable army of guards and groundskeeper spread around the area."

 building_library_05:0 "Library Complex"
 building_library_05_desc:0 "The accumulation of scrolls and books in this building has neccesiated dozens of expansions to the size of the library, and it now forms a labyrinthine complex at the heart of the metropolis."
 building_library_06:0 "House of Wisdom"
 building_library_06_desc:0 "Crawling with wise men from across the world, perusing the libraries many works and adding their own to its vast shelves, the library has become a powerhouse of innovation."

 old_walls_of_oraispol_desc:0 "The 'Old Walls' refer to a series of now mostly obsolete or outright ruined walls and defenceworks that criss-cross the historical heart of Oraispol, some dating as far back as the polis-era. Built, destroyed, rebuilt and modified countless of times throughout the city's history, the walls were ultimately determined to be woefully inadequate in the protection of [aversaria|E]'s capital by Eramos in the 8th century — especially considering the fact that by then, they only protected the ancient nucleus of a city that has drastically grown in preceding centuries — and were replaced by the Aautokratir's own ambitious project.\n\nNowadays, most of the old complex is used either as a structural backbone to housing, storage, lodgings for the city guard, or the home of vagrants, but in an emergency it could still theoretically provide a final line of defense in especially desperate situations - for what little good it would do."
 eramasic_walls_name:0 "Eramasic Walls"
 eramasic_walls_desc:0 "Named after the 8th century Aautokratir that initially ordered their construction (but never lived to see them completed), the Eramasic Walls are a series of imposing stone walls that surround most of modern Oraispol. Unlike the old walls of the city, whose construction and reconstruction was a haphazzard affair that dragged out for over a thousand years, the Eramasic Walls were built with an initial, ambitious design in mind and only rarely fundamentally changed since then.\n\nPossessing numerous towers and heavily fortified gates, the walls would be breached only a handful of times throughout their history, most infamously when they would be left permanently damaged in Aeolus' bombardment of the city with fire magic in the [turmoil_of_the_sixteen_aautokratirs|E]."

 three_gates_of_oraispol_desc:0 "Though the Eramasic Walls have several dozen gates, three in particular stand out - the Flower Gate, the Dour Gate and the Vilnian Gate.\n\nThe so-called 'Flower Gate' (Pylos Anthemos) is the oldest of the three, built during the initial construction of the walls themselves, and is so named both for its colorful and highly ornamented appearance and the tradition of it being covered by flowers during springtime. The Dour Gate, on the other hand, stands as the exact opposite. Built during the reign of an Aautokratir that clearly valued practicality over any kind of aesthetics whatsoever, the gate is often described as an impregnable, blocky monstrosity that is at once both the strongest bulwark and biggest eyesore of the city's entire defense system.\n\nFinally, the Vilnian Gate is most notable for being the most busy thoroughfare of the entire city. Built specifically to allow for an immense volume of foot and horse traffic while still remaining defensive, it is also famous for being the site of the #E Vilnian Assault#! in 1229."
