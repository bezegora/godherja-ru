For a thousand years hence, the tomb has remained under the watch of the Red Guard, who ensure that the dragons remain content in their deathly slumber.

With the Sjalvolki marching ever closer south and the rapid expansion of the [fog|E], the wall was repaired and rebuilt by the local [aversarian|E] warlord Dethyn Kalathyn in an attempt to hold Cenware's horde.

Now, the North Gate represents the last line of defense between [aversarian|E] and the [fog|E], its guards staring ever vigilantly north into the disturbing mist that brushes its walls."

 building_type_kasmeze_cathedral_01_desc:0 "Who originally built the great Citadel at Kasmeze and its attached temple is a question that still has no definitive answer. Most scholars agree that the site benefited greatly from Emperor Partharian's patronage starting around 200, but debates are still ongoing as to whether he had actually built the core of the structure, or Mountain-Sun Temple splinter factions as has been suggested numerous times. In any case, it would quickly become one of the greatest and most prosperous pilgrimage sites of the south, and the Aagiokratia in general, in the following two centuries - even rivaling the likes of the Vounill and Thebastro.\n\nIts stint as a major spiritual center would come to a rapid end in the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], however, as it was first defiled by Count Themos for an arcane ritual in 503, and then further stripped of any valuables by the desperate, penniless governorate of Opakhasia a few decades later. By the end of the crisis, it was but a fire gutted ruin, and due to the general economic decline of the region, it was largely abandoned to its fate.\n\nIn 1147, reconstruction of the building was planned, but was met with delay upon delay until it finally began in 1184. Of course, this brief bout of optimism was soon dispelled as Aversaria descended into the [imperial_civil_war|E] and the site abandoned yet again, its restoration half finished."

Any attempted bridge projects failed spectacularly, through constant accidents from the slave workforce or magical back-casting. By all accounts, the site seems cursed, any attempt to reach it doomed to failure from bad luck more than seemingly any magic in the site itself.\n\nCenware 'Witch-Breaker' and his refugee army would rediscover the site over a hundred years since it had passed from Aversarian interest while journeying west.

While several of Kresox's generals had earned some merit fighting the Sjalvolki, it was no secret that Kresox himself had proven to be as much of a hinderance of the military as the invaders were. Corpulent, greedy and exceptionally hedonistic, Kresox's bitter refusal to show even the basic traits of leadership led to his constant damaging of the war effort and the failure of any organized response to the invasion.\n\nWhen Kresox came to the ancient shrine in this spot to meet with the Witch-Breaker, he had his personal guard turn on his lieutenants and had them brought to Cenware in chains. Kresox offered his generals as slaves, along with the armies, in return for the right to keep his slaves.\n\nThe Witch-Breaker agreed to the offer, and Kresox signed an official declaration ordering the Legions of Kalathipsomi (II 'Proudest', IX 'Purety', VII 'Valor' and XVII 'Pathos') to surrender themselves to the Witch-Breaker immediately. Once the agreement was signed, Cenware ordered Kresox's slaves brought forth so that they may be returned to the Legon, and then had Kresox stripped and thrown to the mass, informing the slaves that the Legon had been returned to them as requested to do as they wished. As Kresox was beaten to death, the Witch-Breaker informed the surrendered legionary's that he formally freed them from their slavery, and ordered them to return to their homes and learn crafts other than war. An offer most were quick to take him up on."

Suddenly, instead of any other normal tree falling down, this tree’s bark turned almost inky black and became resistant to any attempts to cut it down. After a concerted effort on the part of the loggers, a small wound was opened which revealed sap with a rich deep green colour. Upon touching the sap, the man’s hands developed a prickling sensation and a feeling of dread overcame him. Worried about this new development, the men sought help and assistance back in the [aversarian|E] homelands and the news slowly spread into the ears of the rich and powerful.

 building_type_kashiryatower_desc:0 "#E Magic#!:@magic_icon!#positive_value; +1.5#!\n\nLocated in northern Kashirya upon the banks of the shallow Lake Kunsrovsar, the Paerasjatan's Spire is the easternmost tower whose location has been firmly confirmed and documented by Aversaria. Long held as a place of immense spiritual power by the various Avastya Mahani faiths endemic to the region, the area around the tower is clustered with temples, shrines, and small communities of more academically minded [magi|E] and researchers.\n\nAs with most of the other known [towers|E], Paerasjatan's Spire emits a dangerous aura of [magical|E] energy, inducing [overwhelmation|e], [exposure_sickness|E], and death. Unlike many of its counterparts the energies radiating from Paerasjatan's Spire are somewhat unpredictable, with the exact radius at which it is no longer safe to be near the Spire having shrunk and grown dramatically over the millennia. While countless generations of Kashiryan scholars have devised creative theories to predict and explain this fluctuation - ranging from attempts to pin it to the centuries-long greater cycles of [aervalr|E], the correspondance of various constellations, or even the patterns in the flights of certain species of sparrow - none have managed to predict its expansion or contraction with more than a vague accuracy. As such, the territory within the tower's deadly reach is littered with the stonework, artifacts, and unrotting bodies of countless previous generations of researchers, pilgrims, and priests, all slain by the sudden and unexpected expansion of the fickle Spire's aura."

 building_type_redportal_desc:0 "One of the more unique and esoteric finds in the Redlands is the massive sinkhole that seemingly has no bottom. Year on year, however, it's been recorded to get slowly bigger in size. It slowly sucks up all the surrounding land, like a whirlpool of the sea, seemingly never to be seen again. Local lords have tried to cover up the sinkhole to no avail, no matter the size of the object put on top, it will always be broken down and disappear into the depths. Scholars wonder if eventually, it will grow so large that one day it will reach the sea, but their theories have been said to be too outlandish. Nethertheless, the one upside of it is that it makes a fantastic tourist attraction for local lords to sell their wares at."

 building_type_frozenvillage_desc:0 "Despite being located in a land of constant winter, on the coast of an icy lake is a village frozen in time. Only a handful of adventurers have caught a glimpse, as sightings have only occurred during massive blizzards that force even the bravest to turn back. The [fog|E] has only made further attempts even harder, yet famed traveler Trecael den va Surclaes has claimed that the Fog stops just at the village’s edge. The homes come from a time long past; snow-covered thatch huts surround a short, circular platform made out of ice. Many Chevalien scholars have claimed that the village’s existence is dubious at best, but it has not stopped aspiring poets from writing fairytales of the jolly snow-men town of the north."

 building_type_yaawdetmaw_desc:0 "The Yaawdet Maw is located at the formal site of the Reitaghal ra Yaawdet Academy for Scholars of Magic and Science. While the vast majority of records have been lost, it is widely thought that the Maw formed while experimenting with an obscure spell that could transmit thoughts across a room. What resulted was a massive portal appearing on the ceiling of the tallest research tower, immediately filling the laboratory with red sand and suffocating everyone inside. Within minutes, the entire Academy was overrun as the sand crashed through walls and toppled buildings.\n\nAttempts to close the portal have been unsuccessful, with local rulers having to conscript hundreds of ditchdiggers to contain the ever growing pile. Soldiers guard the perimeter against the horrifying monsters lurking beneath. Despite the danger, it is a popular spot for adventurers; the lost knowledge from the Academy is invaluable, and powerful relics from a land far away have arrived with the sand."
