After several days of deliberation, an official decree was announced declaring that the Waypath would be, as it was originally envisioned, free for all to choose as they will. This has been a controversial decision with the nobility, who see the commoners' ability to choose their own path as a violation of their rights and a threat to their way of life, but with the Wayfather's of Chevalie in agreement there is little to be done.\n\nWhile the nobility bicker and complain, the peasantry have largely taken to celebration, though most will still no doubt pointedly encourage their children to follow the Way of Harvests."
