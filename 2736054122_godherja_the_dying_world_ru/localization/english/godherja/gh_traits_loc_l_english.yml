In response, the council began nailing legislation on the door of the palace in Causen's name, any attempt by the king to undo their legislation ignored.\n\nThe councilists were removed from power in the Popular Revolution of 1099, but the party's descendents have continued to vie for a return to the nobility's absolute power since then, many even dreaming of a restoration of the monarchy to give themselves a popular puppet."
