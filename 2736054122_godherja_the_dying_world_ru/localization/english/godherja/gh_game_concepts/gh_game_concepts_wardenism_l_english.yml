 game_concept_the_fratricide_war:0 "The Fratricide War"
 game_concept_the_fratricide_war_desc:0 "A civil war that engulfed the [mamuramat|E] between 961 IS and 967 IS, the Fratricide was the protracted conflict between the sons of the [mamur|E] Yusuf, who had died in 956 IS. His eldest, Essaid had taken the throne as per the Mamur's wishes, but Yusuf's decision to grant his two younger sons Muktafi and Qa'id considerable territories and positions as co-rulers with their older brother rapidly destabilized the situation. Essaid's decision to send his chief minister Al Baraqwi with a small army to arrest Muktafi in 961 caused the already tense situation to escalate into full blown war and Muktafi routed the army and slew Al Baraqwi. The conflict culminated in a grueling year long siege of the capital and horrific street fighting between both army units and civilian partisans. Muktafi and Qa'id's united armies managed to capture their older brother in 966, and promptly beheaded him though the fighting would not end until 967 IS as several of Essaid's generals refused to surrender their arms. The war was the first major civil unrest to occur within the [mamuramat|E] since [the_downfall|E], and is considered by many have been a turning point for the institution. The loss of much of the treasury established by their father left the victorious brothers in debt, forcing the Mamuramat into the hands of Aversarian and Marcher creditors."
 
 #CHARACTERS
 
 game_concept_usun_bishabelik:0 "Usun Bishabelik"
 game_concept_usun_bishabelik_desc:0 "One of the most controversial figures in early Wardenism, Usun was originally the bane of the Great Uprising and one of the only Ritualist warlords to achieve regular success in fending off Wardenite attacks. His presence at - and perhaps active participation in - a number of anti-Wardenite atrocities such as the Dhilesti Massacre and the Qadayea Purge earned him infamy. It was therefore a shock to both the young Wardenite faith and his Ritualist allies when Usun accepted a parlay with the First Warden himself in 302 IS and publically converted to Wardenism. His subsequent vigorous campaigning against the members of his former coalition threw the Ritualist camp into chaos and the Wardenites surged across Sarradon. Opinions on Usun's motivations are sharply divided to this day. Some writers portray him as a man haunted by the horrors of his own actions who desperately sought redemption in a noble cause. Others see him as an ambitious and amoral warlord who saw Wardenism as a way to justify carving his own realm out of the unprotected flanks of his vulnerable allies. The truth is likely lost to history."
 
 game_concept_sanad:0 "Sanad"
 game_concept_sanad_desc:0 "Poet, General, Hero, and Exile, Sanad is perhaps the single most important woman in post [halakdun|E] Sarradonian history, and is regarded today as the mother of the modern [mamuramat|E]. She was the daughter and sole surviving relative of the Eastern [mamur|E] al-Hudi, with every single other member of her family at least five degrees of separation from her father annihilated in arcane fury - a fate often interpreted by historians as evidence al-Hudi was marked as a direct target by the Ritualist [magi|e] who share responsibility for unleashing [the_decimation|E]. Forced to fight tooth and nail for survival, and despite not being raised with the expectation of command, she proved adept at rallying the remnants of her family's armies as the Eastern [mamuramat|E] fought for its life on almost a dozen fronts. Alas, despite her bravery and clear talent for strategy her foes were far too many, and a final defeat at the Battle of Azareq forced her into exile as the [mamuramat|E] crumbled behind her. Arriving in the court of the newly coronated Central Mamur [tathtali|E] in 810 IS, she bartered her disputed title for an alliance and sealed their pact with marriage. Though she directly planned the ensuing wars of reconquest against the East, the newly united Mamuramat's resources were monopolized by affairs closer to home as the chaos of [the_downfall|E] deepened, and only a few of the border provinces were reclaimed. She died of natural causes in 832 IS, but her legacy in the cultural and political institutions of modern Wardenism still lives on."
 
 game_concept_tathtali:0 "Tathtali"
 game_concept_tathtali_desc:0 "The first of the [Concept('the_decimation','post-decimation')|E] Mamurs, Tathtali's fifty six year reign saw the institution of the [mamuramat|E] fundamentally reshaped, and in doing so changed the basis of the Wardenite faith as a whole. No longer would the [mamur|E] share power as one among a coequal set of peers. Instead it would rule as a sacred and absolute monarchy to safeguard the faithful - or at least, that was the theory. In reality these ambitions have been thwarted as often as they have been achieved, and the mounting costs of running the increasingly bloated state apparatus would eventually drive the [mamuramat|E] to barter away coastal territories to both [marchers|E] and [aversarians|E].\n\nAs for Tathtali himself, his reign is considered by many historians to have been a success in the face of the growing anarchy of [the_downfall|E]. Crowned in 809 IS after defeating and killing his magic-maddened father in a civil war, his marriage to [sanad|E] and their subsequent co-equal rule is still a popular subject matter for poets and singers. It is no wonder then that the modern 'mainstream' branch of Wardenism bears his name and sees him as a second founder, so great was his influence upon the religion and its institutions."
 
 game_concept_fourth_mamur:0 "the Fourth Mamur"
 game_concept_far_eastern_mamur:0 "the Far Eastern Mamuramat"
 game_concept_fourth_mamur_desc:0 "Some Wardenites acknowledge a fourth Mamur's existence, a position established in the far east and first held by the Ritualist warlord turned Wardenite convert [usun_bishabelik|E], who claimed the First Warden had personally directed him to lead an army to pursue the Ritualists all the way to Kasharya, a mission which he spent the rest of his ninety year lifespan attempting to achieve. His adopted son Ubaydar was the last to hold it, vanishing without a trace along with an army said to have been ten thousand strong in a suspected gederða in 409 IS. Now lacking both a leader and an army, his already unstable realm collapsed almost overnight, and none have convincingly claimed the title since.\n\nGiven the suspect veracity of Usun Bishabelik's orders, the Far Eastern Mamuramat was largely ignored by its peers, and few Wardenites today remember it as anything more than a quaintly heroic myth."
 
 game_concept_high_judge:0 "High Judge"
 game_concept_high_judge_desc:0 "In Wardenism the role of priest and magistrate are combined into a single figure, that of the judge. Most towns will have at least one judge to administer their court, with larger cities being able to support dozens, even hundreds of such officials. Their duties extend to the management of the complex Wardenite religious law codes, both as justices of the court and as advocates for petitioners. As the Wardenite codes encompass both criminal as well as property and mercantile laws, the job of a judge is quite complex and requires years of training to be judged a master.\n\nJudges who achieve mastery and renown may hope to be appointed as a High Judge, and given jurisdiction over all lower judges - at least in theory. In practice the divergence of different Wardenite legal traditions over the years has resulted in no less than three High Courts claiming the title, each refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the others. The Mainstream High Court is appointed by the Mamur, the Traditionalist High Court has assembled itself in a bottom-up fashion and claims to be merely a provisional body awaiting the Mamurmat's restoration to its true legal limits. The Idealists on the other hand, have a well established court that processes and approves prospective members to its body via meritocratic recommendations from lower judges, and holds itself to be a permanent and independant body."
 
 game_concept_arachas:0 "Arachas"
 game_concept_arachas_desc:0 "The now infamous warlord of the Eastern Isle, Arachas has gone down in history as a notorious villain thanks to his place in the story of early Wardenism. Even the Ritualists have done little to rehabilitate him, as his misrule and apparent inability to comprehend the true magnitude of the threat posed by the Great Uprising is often cited as having allowed the Wardenite faith to entrench itself. Arachas was slain after five years of fighting in the year 302 IS. It is said that his own followers saw fit to bury him in an unmarked grave, and the exact location of his death is now completely lost to history.\n\nExactly why Arachas imprisoned the First Warden has been the subject of much speculation by historians and religious scholars. Two major stories have emerged to explain this:\n\nThe first, popular among romantic storytellers and poets, claims that Arachas was riding through one of his towns, returning from a hunt in the countryside, when he spied a beautiful young woman and fell madly in love. He conspired to have her husband - the soon to be first warden - imprisoned. In brave defiance of Arachas' advances, she proceeded to stab herself to death, either during her husband's arrest or shortly thereafter in the market square.\n\nThe second, more popular amongst serious historians of both the Wardenite and Ritualist faiths, tells that the man who was soon to become the First Warden was unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Arachas' frequent campaigns for the throne of Sarradon left him constantly on the brink of bankruptcy, and he saw the virtuous (though this descriptor is disputed by many of the Ritualist historians) young man's properties and assets as yet another resource he could leverage in pursuit of his political ambitions. The young merchant's defiant response to Arachas' demands for "tribute" earned him a trip to the darkest dungeon in the warlord's citadel. His later release was likely a ploy by Arachas to lure him into revealing where he had hidden some of his money and jewelry, as the warlord expected the man to try and flee the island with as much as he could carry. Instead, he initiated the Great Uprising and sealed Arachas' fate."
 
 game_concept_raqiyya:0 "Raqiyya"
 game_concept_raqiyyas:0 "Raqiyya's"
 game_concept_raqiyya_desc:0 "A renowned early Wardenite legal scholar. Raqiyya, the Niece of Uthsuf b. Iblid the Second Mamur of the West, was born in 382. Raised in the inner circle of Wardenite power and scholarship, as she grew she demonstrated a keen mind and clear talent for legal work. Over her ensuing sixty-two years she put to paper countless commentaries on the First Warden's Laws, as well as the conduct and casework of the first generation of Judges and Mamurs. While she was considered remarkably astute in her own time in the decades and centuries after her death her prominence has grown unceasingly. Today she is one of the most influential legal scholars in the faith besides the First Warden himself. Her writings are so foundational, even-handed, and thorough that they are largely accepted as sound teaching material by all three of the Great Schools of Wardenism. Indeed, some trained scholars have argued that Raqiyya's genius was not only in her careful avoidance of the nascent factional disputes of her day, but that she seemed to have forecasted those which would only emerge centuries after her death.""

 game_concept_mamuramat:0 "Mamuramat"
 game_concept_mamuramat_desc:0 "A central institution in the Wardenite faith, the Mamuramat is equal parts judge, general, and king with its traditional responsibilities straddling the secular and the spiritual. The original Mamurs were lieutenants under the First Warden himself, leaders in the Great Uprising. The names and exact number of these of leaders are somewhat disputed, but the official histories of the modern Mamuramat claim there were exactly three given direction jurisdictions. However, this narrative is often disputed, with many Wardenites claiming it is an [Concept('fourth_mamur','oversimplification')|E] - or even a lie. In modern times only the central Mamur remains, standing alone where its eastern and western siblings have collapsed. They claim to have inherited the authorities bestowed upon their fallen brothers in arms, but the notoriously legalistic Wardenite faith remains split to this day as to whether or not the assumption of powers is actually actually allowed under the law."

Though the West had collapsed, the Mamurs of the Center and the East thrived during this period. Much of Wardenite high legal and court culture first emerges during this time, as the two Mamurs competed for access to scholars and artists. The era saw schools multiply like rabbits, as what was in disfavor in the court of one Mamur was often consciously supported in the competing court. Traditionalism first began to diverge from the Mainline A'Bajjarmi'a in this age. Indeed, it was in 732 that the scholar Laylam bint Ashafara first coined the term. Though she meant it as an insult, it soon caught on among those dissident scholars who disagreed with the growing power of the Mamurs."

This era - ranging to the end of the reign of [tathtali|E]'s heir Uthman in 874 - saw the position of [mamur|E] formally transform itself into something akin to an absolute monarch. It was in this period that the Tabaqai'a Traditionalists would formally sever their ties to their former A'Bajjarmi'a comrades, as the latter finally began to fully commit themselves to the project of legally entrenching the newly unified Mamuramat. Ominously, it was also during this time that the scattered and often proscribed schools who rejected the idea of a Mamur altogether first began to establish an informal network among themselves, taking root along the peripheries of the Mamuramat's territory."

Under the patronage of the newly powerful Mamurs the Mainstream school grew to new heights, as the heirs of Tathtali attempted to export their new ideology to all corners of the Wardenite world. This period would last from 874 until roughly 1155, when the Tel Merrha uprising would bring about the birth of Wardenism's third and youngest tradition."

 game_concept_the_first_warden_desc:0 "The First Warden is a somewhat enigmatic figure despite the long shadow his legacy has cast over Sarradonian history. Born sometime in the mid third century, the man who would later become the First Warden seems to have worked as a merchant and local bureaucrat on the Western Isle until he came to the attention to the island's overlord, the warlord [arachas|E].\n\nThe First Warden wrote four lengthy books which have made it into the Wardenite canon, and his authorship is attributed to almost a dozen other documents and tomes which are considered apocryphal and rejected be one or more sects within the Wardenite faith. The four books which most Wardenites accept are: The Book of Days, The Pillars of Virtue, The Marginalia, and The Visions. The Record of the First Warden's Court, while having been written by scribes and compiled after his death, is also counted among the Wardenite canon as it contains verbatim records of many of the Warden's rulings and legal pronouncements.\n\nThe First Warden died of natural causes in 332, and despite the hopes of his Ritualist enemies that his faith would lose purpose with his passing, it only served to galvanize Wardenism, cementing it into the faith it has become today. Leadership was passed into the hands of his lieutenants, the [Concept('mamur','Mamurs')|E] who would successfully lead the faithful in achieving a dominant position across all of Sarradon."

 game_concept_wardenites:0 "Wardenites"
 game_concept_wardenism_desc:0 "Wardenism is the belief in several spiritual 'Pillars' that instruct one on how to lead a holy life, believing that the Pillars construct a great prison in which an evil god (the Dead God) is imprisoned. Wardenites believe that if too many act impiously and impurely, the Dead God will be freed from Their prison and destroy the realms of man.\n\nThe origins of Wardenism are hotly debated. While it is agreed that 'The First Warden' rose up in 296 against the [ritualist|E] warlords of northern Sarradon's southeast corner and quickly inspired a great revolt among peasants and local leaders both to overthrow the [ritualist|E] establishment. The First Warden claimed to have seen visions of the Dead God while imprisoned on the Eastern Isle by the warlord Arachas, who later became the [great_uprising|E]'s first victim.\n\nThe attacks by The First Warden were the opening battles of the [war_in_heaven|E], which would proceed to consume [sarradon|E] for near 2000 years.\n\nIt is hotly debated whether or not Wardenism was originally a sect of [ritualism|E]. Proponents of the idea point out the similarity between Wardenites belief in metaphorical Towers and various [ritualist|E] sects debate over whether the Tower of Sophocos is metaphorical, as well as the similarities of many beliefs in virtues otherwise. Despite this, however, Wardenites and [ritualists|E] have remained bitter rivals since the age of The First Warden, and most Wardenites consider the idea that Wardenism is a [ritualist|E] sect to be a heresy promulgated by madmen."

 game_concept_era_of_admin:0 "Era of Administration"
 game_concept_era_of_admin_desc:0 "The idealized “second” age of Wardenism, following the end of the [era_of_insurrection|E]. The Era of Administration is the time that will come after Wardenism has established the First Warden’s laws across the world (or just a significant and stable portion of the world), and ensured the Pillars of Virtue will be administered without threat or peril. The faithful claim it will be a time of justice and law, but some Wardenites go further and say that the Era of Administration will be a paradise, where all men shall live in happiness and plenty. The A’Bajjarmi’a and many Traditionalist schools interpret the Era of Administration as being more an ideal state of governance, rather than a distinct period of history to come. Radical reinterpretations of the concept have resulted in a handful of very destructive Millenarian revolts throughout Wardenite history (520, 803, 807, 810, 812, and 1111).\n\nOne of the main divergent opinions held by the Idealist school is that the Era of Administration has already begun, but the Wardenite faithful do not yet know it. Their understanding of this time is also far more limited in scope, and they reject the idea that it will be a paradise - at least not initially."

 game_concept_era_of_insurrection_desc:0 "Also known as the Era of Conquest, this is the “first” age in Wardenite eschatological theory, and one which most Wardenites believe they are still living in. This period is filled with a struggle for supremacy across Sarradon as the Wardenite faithful fight against injustice, sin, and evil. In doing so they are carving out a realm where they can administer the First Warden's laws in order to ensure humanity’s salvation from the Hooded Prisoner. Most Wardenites cite the [great_uprising|E] as the opening of this great Era, though a few sects who have grown to attach greater religious significance to the First Warden himself sometimes claim it truly began with his birth."

With the east secured as their stronghold the Wardenites were able to securely launch invasions against the rest of the continent, lighting aflame all of Sarradon in what would become known as the [war_in_heaven|E]"
