game_concept_battle_of_the_wall_of_astila_desc:0 "The Battle of the Wall of Astila was the final battle in the [bayyuralar|E]. Taking place at what is now known as the Wall of Astila, Baytor rode to relieve the clan of Korsakai Khatan, who had forded across the river and engaged Astilik forces. Outmatched by the Astilik soldiers, Korsakai Khatan held out in hopes of Baytor's forces arriving to relieve him on time. As Baytor's forces forded a brook to get to Korsakai's clan, Baytor's horse lost its footing and threw him off. Though accounts differ, with Baytor's brother and bondsman Mogha writing that he dashed his head upon the rocks and floated off and the leader of the Khaiasheg, Ögotei Tankhatan, writing that he was weighed down by his armor and the masks of the warriors he defeated preventing him from swimming to safety, he drowned before his Khaiashegs could dismount and rescue him. Both his corpse and the sword of his grandfather, [iorne_seld|E], were lost to the river.\n\nAfter his death, his forces were thrown into disarray and many of the clans wanted to desert. However, both Ögotei and Mogha rallied them to rescue Korsakai's forces, and they forded the brook and conducted a pitched battle against the Astiliks, though they were thrown back across the river along with Korsakai and the remnants of his clan. Afterward, the Öltenic horde dispersed in the [aironoian_migration|E].\n\nThe battle proved to be the death-blow to the [otachedian_empire|E], which collapsed soon after. However, it also resulted in an influx of Öltenic cultures and religions in Aironoi, and the emergence of new empires over the next centuries. It is doubtful that Baytor, were he not to have drowned, could have won the battle. The Öltenis were outmatched in equipment, training, and in familiarity with their environs, and Baytor's refusal to augment his forces with Kashiryans resulted in them relying on Öltenic shamans for their [magi|E], who were outmatched by the animal-magi of the Astilik Empire."
game_concept_aironoian_migration:0 "Aironoian Migration"
game_concept_aironoian_migration_desc:0 "The Aironoian Migration was a resettling of Öltenic clansmen in Aironoi in the aftermath of the [battle_of_the_wall_of_astila|E]. After Kagakhatan Baytor's death, his army largely dispersed into warlord groups who displaced or assimilated native cultures in their territory. Foremost of these warlords was Korsakai Khatan, who had survived the battle though was rendered lame by an axe strike to his thigh.\n\nAlthough Korsakai Khatan's clan was mostly wiped out, his martial prowess and charisma allowed him to exert influence over the other warlords, and he proclaimed himself hayakhatan soon after. Other influential khatans in Baytor's army followed suit, though their empires crumbled after their deaths while Korsakai's empire lasted a generation after his own death.\n\nWhile most of the Öltenis that followed Baytor were content to remain in Aironoi and forge their own destinies, the remainder either went back into Kashirya with Ögotei and Mogha or migrated elsewhere. One of the peculiarites of the migration was the view that Baytor was a hero who died before his time; this view was spread by Korsakai, who respected Baytor greatly, while Ögotei and Mogha demonized him upon their return to Kashirya."
