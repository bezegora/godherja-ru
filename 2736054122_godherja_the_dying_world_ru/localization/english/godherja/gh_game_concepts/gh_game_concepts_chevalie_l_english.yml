game_concept_chevalie_migratory_era:0 "The Migratory Era"
game_concept_chevalie_migratory_era_desc:0 "The Migratory Era of Marcher history (not to be confused with the much later, [sjalvolki_migrations|E] of the 13th century) refers to the period in which the proto-Chevaliens first arrived in what would become their permanent home.\n\nComing in from the east in the late 1st century BI — in order to escape thralldom under a now long-dead empire, if tales are to be believed — they would encounter the Gallicader, the native inhabitants of the region, with whom they'd wage brutal warfare for decades to come. Eventually, this would end in the Gallicader largely exiting the stage of major historical importance, the codification of the [lifepath|E] system, and the founding of the first ostensible 'High Kingdom' (though its form would bear little resemblance to its contemporary counterpart). They were led by 'Good King' Bastione, who embodied what would today be considered an ideal monarch in Chevalien eyes - if in fact he had actually existed, which is a matter of some historical dispute.\n\nFrom the outset, despite their victory over the former denizens of [chevalie|E], they would be given little respite in peace, for conflict with the Oejeynicans of the north (which they had themselves provoked, in large part), the Kathanouxaic Empire of the south, and ultimately, the [liches|E], would all come to be existential threats. It was the defeat of the first [arch_lich|E], [vilas_venslau|E], that would mark the end of the Migratory Era in most conventional historians' eyes."

game_concept_the_brutality:0 "The Brutality"
game_concept_the_brutality_desc:0 "The Brutality refers to the massacre of over 200 nobles and their families in 878 IS at the funeral of High King Thamean's son Giliman at his order. The massacre is also often used to refer to the greater purge of their families, homes, and those who did not attend across [chevalie|E] at the same time.\n\nThe massacre directly brought forth the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E] and the [red_river_war|E], generally considered the darkest point in Marcher history. The massacre effectively ended the lineage of the Demonteaux, Klemendair and Viligad noble families, along with two dozen other minor ones, and led to the deaths of nearly every high noble and dynastic head in [chevalie|E]. Thamean himself would kill himself in his throne room soon after in a maddened display, and the historical account is unclear if Thamean meant to cut his wrists deep enough to bleed to death or if it was an accident. Popular tales say that he could have been saved, but his knights were too afeared and ashamed of their High King to do so, and killed themselves soon after to avenge their High King.\n\nThe massacre, besides the murders themselves, caused much controversy for the use of mercenaries leased from the [antimagic_orders|E] for it. Thamean, not trusting his own men to do the deed, instead paid hefty sums to the various holy orders own mercenary companies in order to do it for him and ensure that military forces would not be able to stop them. The reputations of the Orders would be tarnished, and would not be recovered until the end of the [red_river_war|E] and the sacrifice of [champion_of_chevalie|E], the Orders soon after declaring neutrality in Marcher politics and focusing their mercenary work abroad."

game_concept_anarchy_of_the_five_crowns:0 "Anarchy of the Five Crowns"
game_concept_anarchy_of_the_five_crowns_desc:0 "The Anarchy of the Five Crowns was a period of Marcher history regularly considered to be the lowest point in the known memory of [chevalie|E] that lasted from 878 IS to 939 IS. After the maddened High King Thamean reacted to the murder of his son Giliman with madness, having the entirety of the high nobility and their families massacred in the [the_brutality|E], he soon after killed his children and then himself in a maddened display in his throne room. With the death of the High King, his family, the extinction of several of the most important noble houses in [chevalie|E] and the devastation of most others, all law and order in the realm collapsed. The proceeding anarchy left all power in the hands of minor lords and city leaders, who quickly began warring with one another over old debts or attempts to reunite [chevalie|E].\n\nFive kingdoms eventually emerged from the chaos, though dozens more still claimed independence, and would battle one another for the final twenty years of the Anarchy. Kings of the families of Montegon, Valadec, Illurdian, Den va Pontaget and Den va Seignon families would further torture the land in the war; and the [antimagic_orders|E] would regularly join the highest bidder as mercenaries. The war between the Five would eventually culminate in the [red_river_war|E], a final conflict between the five which was interrupted by the invasion of the [arch_lich|E] [silas_stavro|E].\n\n[stavro|E] would get further than nearly any other [lich|E] and reach the interior of Peti Gisredde. He was only stopped by [champion_of_chevalie|E], who united the [antimagic_orders] and pretender kingdoms and then sacrificed himself to slay the [lich|E] in one on one combat in the Palace of Gisredde."

game_concept_red_river_war:0 "Red River War"
game_concept_red_river_war_desc:0 "The Red River War was the closing conflict of the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E] between the Montegon, Valadec, Illurdian, Den va Pontaget and Den va Seignon families. Beginning with an assault of Mond Graz Castle in Illurdian lands by the Montegons, the three other kingdoms soon used the conflict to launch their own invasions as well, assisted by mercenary [antimagic_orders|E] who had long given up pretenses of fighting the [liches|E] and [magi|e] in order to work as mercenaries for the competing warlords.\n\nWhile the war went on for several years before the invasion from the north, it is mostly detailed in the history books with the invasion of the [archlich|E] [silas_stavro|E] who proved to possibly be the most cunning [lich|E] the [marchers|E] had ever fought. With strategy, intrigue, and being able to keep the [liches|E] under his command thoroughly beaten down, the [liches|E] soon overwhelmed the Marches and invaded the last free Marcher city of Peti Gisredde.\n\nWhile [silas|E] burned the Marches, [champion_of_chevalie|E] seemingly rose from the ashes. Their origins, name, and even gender have since been lost to history, but what is known is they embarked on a great quest to unite the disparate [antimagic_orders|E] and warlords against the [liches|E]. Taking command of the [antimagi|E] and uniting them for the first time in history, and soon after convincing the various remaining kings to agree to peace, the Champion then led a united Marcher army to contest the invasion of Peti Gisredde. Within the burning city, they dueled [silas_stavro|E] and sacrificed themselves to slay the [lich|E], ending the [red_river_war|E] and the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E]."

game_concept_war_of_the_heretic_princes:0 "The War of the Heretic Princes"
game_concept_war_of_the_heretic_princes_desc:0 "The War of the Heretic Princes (or The Heresies) was a massive wave of heretical thought in [chevalie|E] that nearly ended a near millennia of uninterrupted worship of the ‘[lifepath|E]’.\n\nThe wars were a result of a long history of [clerical_control_of_chevalie|E] that came to a head in 999 IS when the preacher Urso Becledièvre declared several ‘accompaniments’ to the interpretation of the [lifepath|E] and began preaching for radical changes from mainline thought. While clerical soldiers initially tried having him arrested, soldiers of the Duke of Sauvessagne guarded Urso and then Duke Michel Frink used this new religious conflict to declare himself free from the Conclave of Raocourt and his responsibilities to the church, reclaiming the [Concept('clerical_control_of_chevalie','Right of Choice')|E] and imprisoning any Wayfather who refused to give him full control of clerical lands and functions.\n\nThe event was widely circulated across [chevalie|E], and new faiths by emboldened preachers began appearing almost monthly. Secular warlords were fast to use these new faiths to secure their rule, and the situation deteriorated so quickly that it is credited with causing the collapse of the Deyvidian High Kingdom shortly after its reunification.\n\nWhile the Conclave was slow to react and struggled to find its footing after such a great challenge, it finally began a true response in 1011 IS with the Council of Ex and its declaration of Becledièvre and any other mendicant preachers as arch-heretics, as well as officially declaring the crime of attempting to disrupt the Waypath worthy of death. This would begin nearly forty years of religious warfare across [chevalie|E], which would finally end in the Agreement of Raocourt, which saw the various religious leaders either executed, exiled, or returned to the fold, and the secular warlords once again swearing themselves to [lifepath|E] orthodoxy. Despite the Conclave’s victory, however, the long history of [clerical_control_of_chevalie|E] was effectively over."

#CHARACTERS

game_concept_champion_of_chevalie:0 "The Champion of Chevalie"
game_concept_champion_of_chevalie_desc:0 "The Champion of [chevalie|E] is one of the great heroes of Marcher lore. Rising up during the [red_river_war|E] in 938 IS against [arch_lich|E] [silas_stavro|E], the Champion soon after united the disparate and fallen [antimagic_orders|E] (whether or not the Champion themself was an [antimagi|E] is hotly disputed) and the warrings kings both and marched southwest alongside a brotherhood of other storied heroes to relieve the Siege of Peti Gisredde by the [gh_general_undead|E] forces.\n\nWhile the origin, name, gender, and so on of the Champion are different in every tale, what is remembered is that they sacrificed themselves in one on one combat against [stavro|E] in the Palace of Gisredde as the city burned in battle. While the Champion reportedly fell in the conflict, the [arch_lich|E] was killed as well, ending the [red_river_war|E] and the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E].\n\nThe Champion was declared a Waysaint after their death of the Path of Justice (though their actual Lifepath has also been forgotten, many have claimed they in fact mastered every Path), and the [antimagic_orders|E] declared neutrality in future Marcher affairs in their memory."

game_concept_marcher:0 "Marcher"
game_concept_marchers_desc:0 "The Marchers are the people of modern [chevalie|E]. Not native to the [shattered_coast|E], records of their modern history only begin with their migration into [the_marches|E] and their conquests of the Gallicaders, with primary sources being written well over a hundred of years after the fact, or recovered from what little surviving Oejeycian government documents from the era remain.\n\nWhile Marcher history before their conquest is largely shrouded by the thick veil of time, it is known that a figure known as the ‘Good King’ Bastione (it is unknown if Bastione was in fact the figure’s actual name or a merging of folklore with history) led them over the Black Mountains to the east after a long period of slavery to a now dead empire, and over the following century his people would either subjugate, destroy, or merge with the native Gallicaders who called the region their home. Whether contemporary Marcher culture is wholly descended from this group, or the result of a merging with their erstwhile foes is unknown. Additionally, some modern scholars have (oft controversially) proposed that ancient Marchers bore many a striking similarity to the eastern clans now called the Sjalvolki.\n\nThe [chevalien|E] are known as the creators of the modern [antimagic|E] Arts, no doubt developed and honed to perfection throughout the thousand years of conflict with the Liches of the north, and a history of wars with the Aversarians to the east. They are also known as exceptionally shrewd businessmen, poor Marchers in many of the more war-torn portions of Chevalie often using the belief in the Lifepaths to study the mercantile arts and find their fortune overseas as merchants or mercenaries. In [chevalie|E] itself, they are known for their general inability to achieve lasting unity - rarely does a dynasty hold the title of High King for more than a scant few generations, and always do they deal with frequent rebellion. In Chevalie, it is believed that only the strongest should be able to rule the throne, for if anyone less does, then how can they be trusted to hold a realm so constantly at threat from the north? Because of this, challenges to the throne are frequent, and rarely does the realm survive them intact."

game_concept_antimagi:0 "Anti-Magi"
game_concept_antimagi_desc:0 "Anti-Magi is a catchall term for any warrior dedicated to fighting [magic|E] practitioners and [magical|E] beasts both. [antimagic|E] is an extremely dangerous skill, and exceptionally risky, making true dedicated warriors to the craft rare and oft short-lived.\n\nAnti-Magi are most commonly found in [chevalie|E], where the Anti-Magic Field of the Marcher homeland assists them in their ventures. There, dozens of [antimagic_orders|E] work to perfect the craft and regularly sell their crafts overseas when not fighting [magi|E] in their own lands."

game_concept_antimagic_order:0 "Anti-Magic Order"
game_concept_antimagic_orders_desc:0 "The Anti-Magic orders is the name for the various knightly orders of [chevalie|E] dedicated to the [antimagic|E] arts. An [antimagi|E] of any of the hundreds of historic Orders is generally considered one of the finest warriors of the world, though how much of this is legend and how much is reality is up to debate.\n\nDespite their fearsome reputation, the Orders, (or fraternities, as the Chevaliens often call them) vary greatly in organization and discipline. While many are dedicated warrior-orders focusing entire lifes on the arts and even going as far to disavow personal lives as to better hone their crafts, others are loosely united honorary orders that meet only a few times a year if ever.\n\nRegardless, the Anti-Magic Orders are exceptionally respected in [chevalie|E] and in much of the world. The Orders generally fund themselves through donation and any lands they directly administer, but increasingly they have found great wealth in selling their services overseas, and the [antimagi|E] find mercenary work to be an excellent opportunity for training."

#LOCATIONS

game_concept_chevalie:0 "Chevalie"
game_concept_the_marches:0 "The Marches"
game_concept_chevalie_desc:0 "Chevalie is a large realm sitting between former [aversarian|E] Kalathipsomi to the east (the western edge of the Black Mountains delineating the modern border) and the Lichdoms to the north.\n\nHome of the [marchers|E] (or Chevaliens), it is renowned for its wide reach across the world in the form of a vast diaspora of merchants, mercenaries, and adventurers. Home of the [antimagic|E] arts as well as numerous political and mercantile innovations, it is said that in every port in the world, [chevalien|E] can be spoken, a deal can be made, and a fortune can be stolen.\n\nChevalien history is normally broken down into five periods, beginning with the Migratory Era which followed the arrival of the modern [marchers|E] into the area, their wars with the Gallicaders and the Ocyzecyn, and conventionally taken to end with the codification of the modern Lifepaths and [chevalien|E] culture and the rise of the first [arch_lich|E], [vilas_venslau|E]. Following this is the Imperial Era, during which the High Kingdom would expand to control most of modern Kalathipsomi, all the way up to the Black Gates in the east, and ending with the collapse of the [chevalien|E] empire in the east and its conquest by [aversaria|E]. The Theocratic Era followed, as the Conclave of Raocourt and the [antimagic_orders|E] began exerting massive political influence and control, regularly meddling in the domestic affairs of local warlords, ending with the [red_river_war|E]; and finally the Secular Era (or the Heretical Era), which saw the splintering and reformation of the [lifepath|E] and the rise of the modern feudal system as secular lords took control of numerous political systems formerly in control of the clergy.\n\nChevalie has spent most of its history disunited, peace a more uncommon state of affairs than war - in large part thanks to the unique culture of the Marcher people."

#MISC

game_concept_antimagic:0 "Anti-Magic"
game_concept_antimagic_desc:0 "Anti-Magic is a term used to refer to any method of fighting meant to directly counter [magical|E] beasts and [magic|E] practitioners. Modern styles of the art are primarily descended from [chevalie|E], where Lady Hegraux 'Cryptbreaker' wrote 'the Fourteen Techniques of Silence' and gave birth to the modern [antimagic_orders|E]. In [chevalie|E], she is regarded as the mother of Anti-Magic.\n\nAnti-Magic is often mythologized as a [magic|E] of its own, but this is a popular myth. In actuality, Anti-Magic is a martial art based around quickly disabling and killing [magic|E] users. The various fighting styles generally revolve around rapid movement to close range with a [magi|E], techniques to quickly disable the [magi|E]'s hands or finish them if possible, and how to move quietly or unnoticed on a battlefield to avoid detection. Marksmanship is often common, many [antimagi|E] attempting to kill [magi|E] from far enough to not be noticed. More modern adherents also often make use of recent alchemical inventions, such as 'Lightning Bottles' to stun [magi|E] with extremely bright and loud bangs and 'Smokers' to cover their advance. More rarely but increasingly frequently, one-handed crossbows and focusing mirrors (to blind opponents) have been used."

game_concept_antimagic_terrain:0 "Anti-Magic Terrain"
game_concept_antimagic_terrain_basic:0 "Anti-Magic"
game_concept_antimagic_terrain_desc:0 "An oddity on Aeras, Anti-magic terrain is the bane of magic in all its forms. From the terrible spells conjured forth by [magi|E], to the enchantments wreathing awe inspiring artifacts, all is sapped away as if drawn in a whirlpool or vortex downwards, absorbed into the very soil itself. Those blessed with the ability to see such energies sometimes claim that the energies thus stolen are not actually destroyed, but instead seem to soak into the ground itself, pulled as if by an unseen current towards some unknown location.\n\n Though living in anti-magic terrain is frustrating to most [magi|E], its effects are not absolute. Those skilled enough in the magical arts are able to compensate somewhat, overboosting their spells to ensure they can still produce some effect, though the results are never what they would be elsewhere. For instance, a [magi|E] conjuring a mighty firestorm to engulf an army will find their efforts result in a powerful but highly localized pillar of flame immolating just a few unlucky soldiers. A [lich|E] capable of controlling a legion of undead will similarly find any regiment they are not directly concentrating upon begins to crumble or starts to act independently of their will. Most famously the [lich|E] Wylytas Wysslyw's invasion of [chevalie|E] in 1001 IS collapsed without outside intervention after he advanced just a few miles inside the High Kingdom's borders. It is recorded that his undead servitors suddenly turned upon him en masse during a megalomaniacal sermon, and the invasion force was devastated by the ensuing anarchic melee.\n\nThankfully for the great and powerful of Aeras, anti-magic terrain is rare, and only dominant in just one particular region: [chevalie|E]. If there are any other large territories under a similar effect, they have yet to become well known to the world's scholars."

game_concept_fraternity_of_chevalie:0 "Fraternity of Chevalie"
game_concept_fraternity_of_chevalie_desc:0 "'The Fraternity of [chevalie|E]' is the common term for the Marcher concept of brotherhood among Chevaliens. Often used as an insult for Marcher duplicity but seen as a great mark of pride by the [marchers|E] themselves, the concept itself was popularized in the 9th century by the poet Abaël Venodau, whose eleven famous poems established the first proper concepts of Marcher unity in the literary tradition.\n\nThe concept itself is the belief that in dealings with foreigners, other Chevaliens should always come first. No matter what, if a foreigner means to do harm to [chevalie|E] or its people, it is the duty of the [chevalien|E] to stop them. This is most commonly seen in the constant collapse and reunification of the region, the [marchers|E] happily battling one another until the rise of an outside threat, and then always rapidly reunifying until the threat is ended and they can safely go back to killing one another."

game_concept_clerical_control_of_chevalie:0 "Clerical Control of Chevalie"
game_concept_clerical_control_of_chevalie_desc:0 "For much of [chevalien|E] history, the clergy has held equal or even higher authority than the secular lords. Beginning shortly after the first Life Path High King in 234 IS, the newly established Conclave of Raocourt would begin to exert great control over its lords and followers via the new faith. The most direct form of manipulation was through the concept of the 'Right of Choice' (who in a realm, if anyone, has the right to dictate which [lifepath|E] an adherent can follow). Secular lords had great interest in being able to either decide their subjects' Path or remove any ability to determine it altogether, while the clergy wished to be able to choose in order to control the lords and commoners both.\n\nLong conflicts over the concept and other conflicts of interest effectively ended in the 821 IS Concordate of Theyslaux, an agreement by the [chevalien|E] Kings at the time that the ultimate Right of Choice rested with the clergy. This (along with the rise of northern bureucratic systems) led to an increasing codification of the clergy’s rights to control [chevalien|E] society, with the clergy often going so far as to use their power to have noble lords replaced with their chosen successors.\n\nConflict between the clergy and secular lords was increasingly common, culminating in the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E] in 878 IS, along with [the_brutality|E]. With the clergy splitting along secular lines and supporting various Kings, and the [antimagic_orders|E] serving as mercenaries to the highest bidder, trust in the secular functions of the clergy plummeted.\n\nAfter the [red_river_war|E], in the name of the honor of the [Concept('champion_of_chevalie','Champion of Chevalie')|E], the various [antimagic_orders|E] swore to the ‘Rites of Noncompliance’, which stated that the Orders would no longer meddle in domestic [Concept('marcher','chevalien')|E] affairs. The similar ‘Orders of Separation’ formally broke the [antimagic_orders|E] off of the Conclave of Raocourt’s jurisdiction. With their militant branch now independent and with little good will among the nobility and the peasantry both, the Conclave and clergy at large struggled to maintain control of their flock.\n\nThe end of the Conclave's influence would come with the [war_of_the_heretic_princes|E], where it had lost the majority of its church lands in the conflicts thanks to the opportunism of secular lords, and would never again come close to the amount of control it exerted over [chevalie|E] thereafter. The next High King to reunite [chevalie|E] after the event, Oliërs den va Hadcourte-Vedron, would famously require the assorted Wayfather’s to prostrate themselves and request the right to crown him, a controversial yet clear sign that the function of the clergy would officially be secondary to that of the hereditary nobility."

game_concept_lifepath:0 "Lifepath"
game_concept_lifepath_desc:0 "The Lifepath is the religious system traditionally attributed to the [marchers|E] of [chevalie|E]. It is unknown if it descends from a unified belief system or if it is simply the result of a codification of ancient [chevalien|E] culture, and the topic of such is debated fiercely among the [chevalien|E] scholarly class to this day.\n\nAdherents to the Lifepath believe that there is no true god, but in perfecting oneself in their chosen role in life that they may reach a point of spiritual perfection and achieve sainthood. In the beliefs of the Lifepath, those who reach perfection in their path will become a Waysaint after death, and will forever look after and guide those following in their footsteps forever after. To this end, Pathfathers of each of the major Paths can be found in most holy places, where they serve as a form of job trainers for their adherents to help guide them along their Path.\n\nThere have been dozens of recorded Paths in Marcher history, though most do not survive for very long due to a lack of Wayfathers and Adherents. Seven of the current eight recognized Paths, however, have been practiced for hundreds of years. With the exception of the Path of Nullification, the art of [antimagic|E]."

[prepact_gisredde|E] was the only remaining realm to not bow, free since the [three_pier_war|E] and Aloysian saw Gisredde’s vast wealth and obstinate independence as a continual threat. The following siege was brief, before the [council_of_gisredde|E] realized it had little chance of resistance and opened its gates.\n\nAloysian’s soldiers occupied the city and the Council swore oaths of fealty. They would then scheme against him, however, and Gisreddean stubbornness and the Council’s plots undermined his rule. An attempt to raise taxes on the ‘Path Blessed Guild of Gisreddean Shoemakers’, an artisan league, led to the cobblers rising in rebellion along with the rest of the city. The Council hired a host of mercenaries to assist, and soon Aloysian’s army withdrew in shame.\n\nAs Aloysian gathered forces to sack the city, the Council sought a treaty.

The ancient black-stone docks of [peti_gisredde|E] gave the war its name, upon which locals claim served as the battleground.\n\nWhen Mical Wisestar inherited his father’s Viceroyalty of the West, he struggled to keep his realm unified. His first target in a campaign to force vows of loyalty was the scattered villages of Gisredde, that were (dubiously) his rightful lands. To force his control, he brought with him a force of five hundred soldiers.\n\nThe [council_of_gisredde|E] thereafter formed in a barn to debate the crisis. Folk-lore says [jan_va_gisredde|E] then stirred the Council into action, though the truth of this is doubtful. Regardless, the Council raised a militia of locals and mercenaries, and would score a completely unexpected victory against Mical in the following ‘war’ (an hour long battle).

As was tradition, the [council_of_gisredde|E] in both cities resisted from the shadows. The general uprising in Grande Gisredde went into chaos, however, as Wayfather Ayr den va Seychund launched a bloody coup in his home city, declaring himself patriarch of Gisredde and the Council of Grande Gisredde abolished. Seeing an opportunity to spite Peti Gisredde, King Karth allied Seychund, leaving Peti Gisredde powerless to respond.\n\nGisreddean unity would then end, Grande Gisredde often given support by local lords to check Peti Gisredde. Yet Seychund's rise would still end swiftly, the Wayfather murdered by former council members, and Grande Gisredde soon faced an endless series of coups and uprisings. After the city experienced nearly every type of government imaginable (including a briefly lived Magocracy led by three over-eager followers of the Path of Crows and traveling [aversarian|E] Hedge-Magi [machyos_prothex|E]), the [lich|E] [silas_stavro|E] pillaged it at the conclusion of the [red_river_war|E] which many considered more a mercy than a crime.

Many would attempt to annex Gisredde to mixed results, most notably High King Aloysian in the third century.

There, on the roof of the Palace of Gisredde, the Champion and Stavro battled. The Champion and Stavro would both fall, ending the [red_river_war|E].

When they flocked to the many houses of passion, the courtesans opened the doors, their legs, and then the soldier's throats with concealed knives. In hours, the whores slaughtered hundreds of Illurdian's soldiers, and even more fell when the rest of the citizenry rose in a great mob led by blood-covered whores.\n\nThe Winking Rose claimed the lives of not only many soldiers but also Illurdian cousin, and soon his armies retreated. Illurdian agreed to a peace, restoring the Gisreddepact but losing so many men that his realm soon collapsed. In return for losing his realm, Illurdian received a yearly tithe of ten silver Gisreddean coins.

Legends say that the scattered villages formed the emergency council to debate escaping the Viceroy of the West [mical_wisestar|E]’s demands for fealty (and taxes). Initially comprising locals, the villages pooled their meager wealth and bribed passing merchants, warriors and mercenaries into joining. Desperation likely led to local criminals also being welcomed. Local legend says the likely apocryphal [jan_va_gisredde|E] would rouse them to fight Mical. They agreed, but insulted by his brashness they gave him a host of livestock to lead, which Jan then used to attain victory.\n\nDespite a muddled founding, the Council continued to lead thereafter. As Peti Gisredde grew, the council would become a byzantine senate of merchant leagues, artisan chapters, local notables, assassin and thief’s guilds, [Concept('clerical_control_of_chevalie','knightly orders')|E], [Concept('gisreddean_banking_system','banking organizations')|E], noble houses, [Concept('gisreddean_banking_system','high-ranking Wayfathers')|E] and more.

Serving the mysterious successor to Good King Bastone, Wisestar gathered a large host and conquered western Chevalie from the last Gallicader clans there, establishing Inianvilla over their holy site of [sweverg_irssraedl|E], Inianvilla one day becoming [peti_gisredde|E]. For his victory, Inian gained the title Viceroy of the West.\n\nDespite being declared a Waysaint of Justice and his establishment as a folk-hero, Wisestar’s historical character is controversial. Marcher tales speak of a wise and clever ruler who tricked Gallicaders into revealing their evils, then slaying or converting them. [aversarian|E] scholars in the 10th century claimed otherwise. Historical records that match Gallicader legends showed a Wisestar known for brutal cruelty against the Gallicaders, of endless political plots and schemes, and constant feuding with neighboring lords out of desire to further his power.\n\nRegardless of his virtue, Wisestar would fend off several Gallicader rebellions and firmly end their hope of restoration, and rule for some thirty years before his assassination by Gallicader rebels, the Viceroyalty passing to his son, [mical_wisestar|E]. His legacy would not last, Mical’s reign facing many misfortunes (such as the [three_pier_war|E]) which ended in the Viceroyalty’s disbandment and annexation by neighboring warlords."

The Wisestar name was likely given to Mical, by Mical, to buoy his fleeting prestige. It is perhaps his one lasting legacy; the name passing to his father centuries later.\n\nDespite his father’s firm grip on power, Mical faced growing rebellions from Marcher and Gallicader rebels both. With the High Kingdom’s collapse, the onus of stabilizing his realm fell solely on him, an exceptionally difficult task that he struggled to match. During a campaign to bring all lands his father controlled back under his control, he entered conflict with (then little more than several villages) [peti_gisredde|E].\n\nThis was an unexpected disaster, and Mical would face a humiliating defeat in the following [three_pier_war|E], fables often claiming because of the efforts of folk-hero [jan_va_gisredde|E]. Failing to capture so much as a string of minor villages, Mical was overthrown, and the Viceroyalty disbanded and its neighbors soon annexed its lands.

Scholars claim that if real, his name would likely have been the then more common dng mal Girssred, a simplification of the town's name, Svergirssred (which was already a bastardization of the Gallicader [sweverg_irssraedl|E].)\n\nWhen [mical_wisestar|E] invaded in the [three_pier_war|E], it is said that Jan marched into the [council_of_gisredde|E] (then ruling from a barn) and berated the wavering notables to fight. Buoyed but insulted by his stubborn words, they put him in charge of a force of ten cows, four pigs, and two very wise ravens. They jokingly named him leader of all of Gisredde's livestock and bade old Jan to fight with his animals while they gathered a militia.Tales say Jan knew of an ancient door on his lands and opened it, unleashing a 12-legged beast that Gisreddeans claim had a cow's form, a snake's tail, two dragon wings and a snout that breathed fire. Jan then led his (primarily bovine) force and flanked Mical's army while it verged on victory against the militia. Mical’s soldiers cornered Jan on one of the black-stone docks, which he defended for an hour with naught but a pitch-fork before the ten cows barreled the soldiers into the sea.\n\nThe tales normally end with Jan using a piece of masonry from a broken home to lay the first stone of what would become the Palace of Gisredde, where a statue of Jan now stands proudly, pitchfork in hand with a cow sitting at his feet."

The only thing agreed on between both images is that he traveled through each governance of Aversaria, [chevalie|E], across all of Aironoi and then to Kashirya and possibly Kathun-Kai, aiding locals wherever he went.\n\nThe Aversarian version of the tale speaks of an imperious Magi who found himself forced to help degenerate weak-blooded foreigners wherever he went, normally being worshipped as a god by them after saving them singularly from their self-made destruction and admonishing them with knowledge of the Purest. Tales also tell of him wiping out cultures of those he deemed truly impure, despising any daring to try and steal Aversaria's light.\n\nMachyos's other historical narrative is that found within contemporary accounts from the lands he traveled. Prothex was often noted as a surpisingly shabby man despite the propaganda of his homeland, and one reticent to reveal his noble blood or magical ability. Instead, Machyos was simply bored, wishing to find interesting things in the world and meet interesting people. With a strong sense of right and wrong, Machyos would often involve himself in local matters to keep those he deemed innocent and pure safe, often making new traveling companions along the way. Most notably is perhaps his friendship with the Kashiryan Magi-Guru Vogib, who aided him in saving Kasihrya during [sabar_lambay_raad|E]."
