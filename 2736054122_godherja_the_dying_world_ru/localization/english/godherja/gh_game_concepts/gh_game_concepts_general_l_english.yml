game_concept_aeras_desc:0 "Aeras is the name for the sole inhabited planet around which revolves the sun and the cosmos. Although many religions ascribe its creation to a multitude of gods, or to one god, its was in truth made by an [ancient_god|E] who longed for company. Scarred by ancient wars, disasters, and an alien race, Aeras has a long and forgotten history and has faced more dooms than anyone can really know."

game_concept_prehistory_desc:0 "Prehistory is considred any time not on the modern Imperial calendar. Aversarians believe the world was founded at 24,000 BE by the 'Purest'.\n\nIn actuality, the world was formed anywhere from 20,000 to 400,000 years before this. As hundreds of different ways to track time have passed, and time as modern humans know it has not always existed (possibly only truly starting after the Godherja) it is impossible to accurately date most of human history.\n\nRoughly, [aersanon|E] created the world after several aeons in the void, [aersanon|E] then created humanity to attempt to make beings to converse with. Humanity was allowed to create its own kingdoms, all which worshipped [aersanon|E], but [aersanon|E] grew tired of humanity's imperfections and created the [aelfir|E]. The [aelfir|E] conquered and enslaved humanity and formed their own empires, and after several hundred thousand years, humanity rose up and destroyed the [aelfir|E] and [aersanon|E] both in the Godherja."

game_concept_marcher_aversarian_wars_desc:0 "The Marcher-Aversarians Wars were a series of conflicts between the [marchers|E] of [chevalie|E] and the [aversarians|E] roughly between 344 IS to 631 IS, though skirmishes and border wars have been common before and after.\n\nThe Wars began in earnest in 344 IS with the invasion of [black_emperor|E] Yakub 'Illspeaker' Yakovad into [chevalie|E], which brought most [chevalien|E] forces in the Marcher colonies in what is now Kalathipsomi back to the homelands to resist the invasion. Rebuffed from Aironoi by the Astliks and recovering from the Last Dragon Rebellion, the Aversarians invaded the Marcher colonies in their ever-growing desire to dominate more lands.\n\nThe initial war was hard fought, with Yakub 'Illspeaker' eventually defeated, Marcher [antimagi|E] wreaked havoc upon the Aversarians using guerilla tactics against the rugged outlands of Kalathipsomi. The initial series of wars only ended in 569 IS, when both sides, thoroughly exhausted and struggling to resist outside threats while dealing with the other agreeing to draw a new border. [aversaria|E] would gain the majority of Kalathipsomi with the Chevaliens retaining the Black Mountains and all lands west of them.\n\nSeveral smaller wars would be fought for the mountains themselves until 631 IS when the [bloodblight|E] wiped out much of [chevalie|E]'s nobility and the [marchers|E] withdrew west, Aversarian settlers soon filling their former holdings. The modern border between de-jure [chevalie|E] and Aversaria has remained since."

game_concept_chaos_of_the_seventh_century_desc:0 "The Chaos of the Seventh Century was a series of disastrous series of events that began in the late 5th century and ended around 760 IS. While the chaos primarily struck [aversaria|E], it nevertheless also struck much of [chevalie|E] and [sarradon|E]. While many scholars believe that it was simply poor luck, others have suggested that it was in fact a powerful Gederða which inflicted poor luck upon [the_continent|E]\n\nThe Chaos began with the invasion of the [arch_lich|E] Adwaga Adwakampy into [chevalie|E] and the rise of the [aversarian|E] [lich|E] Count Themos in eastern Opakhasia. As the two Liches wreaked havoc, especially due to a collapse in Marcher authority and the [aversarian|E] throne being sat on by a mere child, a powerful series of Gederða began tearing [aversarian|E] cities back and forth through the timeline seemingly at random. Further exacerbating this was a large civil war that quickly broke out between the governors of Kalathipsomi and Malcois in the midst of the invasions.\n\nNot long after, the [bloodblight|E] began its rampage across the world from [aversaria|E]. With the southwest weakened from these calamities, the Kartharadd Imperium launched a massive invasion into [aversaria|E] and conquered most of Malcois, only being beaten back after a brutal near fifty years of war which ended with the defeat of the last Kartharaddi army at the Battle of the Riduvian Barrows in 760 IS, marking the end of the Chaos."

game_concept_frodbrokna_desc:0 "A massive [magical|E] attack used by Aeschraes on the 1.3.1200 to kill Axiaothea during the [imperial_civil_war|E]. Killed thousands of [aversarians|E] (nearly half of the population) and stripped most of the survivors of their control of [magic|E]. While Axiaothea and most of her followers were killed in Frodbrokna, it is unclear if that was because the spell worked or just a result of the mass devastation. The sheer [magical|E] power it introduced to the world, along with the great amount of human pain and suffering, caused [aersanon|E] to gasp in death, bringing forth the [fog|E], destroying Aervalr, and tearing reality."

One of many 'Gods', Aersanon was the only one even comprehendible to humans in any form, for Aersanon made humans in Their image and the bounds of their mind are drawn by the limits of their perception of Aersanon.\n\nAersanon created humanity out of a desire to find companionship, but was disappointed when humanity proved to be unable to meet them at their level. Despite humanity worshipping Aersanon as a god, Aersanon cast them aside and created the [aelfir|E]. Happy at the improvements made, Aersanon was nevertheless disappointed with the inherent cruelty and insanity in their blood, and began a third project when They were struck down during the Godherja.\n\nThe dead mind of Aersanon, or at least of Aersanon's image on Aeras, is the source of [gedeora|E], [odrstund|E], and [frodbrokna|E]. Their blood is the source of [living_magic|E], their body the source of [dead_magic|E], and their mind the source of [mixed_magic|E]. [magic|E] is more powerful around the [towers|E] from which They ruled, and along the paths upon which They tread.\n\nTens to hundreds of thousands of years since their 'death' (insofar as such a concept applies to a God), Aersanon has been forgotten by all besides the most childish or esoteric of fairytales and religious lore."

She, along with her four children (the [dragons|E] Iluthunax, Parthagad, Olaxanat and Kutharax) proceeded to scour much of Aversaria, exacting tribute from local lords of wantonly slaughtering entire cities as they saw fit.\n\nArthenax slew the entirety of over six Aversarian Legions and over two hundred [magi|E] who attempted to stop her before finally being confronted by Aautokratia Aeliadias in a legendary duel in southern Opakhasia. Aeliadias proved herself the strongest Magi of a generation in killing the beast and her children. The magical flames conjured by Aeliadias were so powerful that Arthenax was burned away until her bones turned into blackened stone, and her remains still remain where they fell so long ago. While Arthenax is considered the last living [dragon|E], it is unknown from where she came from, and the believed extinction is only due to the lack of verifiable reports of other [dragons|E] since."

Whether they can still be considered human, [mutated|E] human, or a form of [fogbeast|E] is hotly debated, and little is known about the particulars of their 'culture' or beliefs.\n\nWhat is known is that they were once a series of tribes scattered across the far northeast, and unlike most who die when trapped within the [fog|E], they instead adapted to it and changed into something different. They now uniformly worship what they call the 'Mistmother', a personification of the [fog|E], who they believe speaks to them through it.\n\nFogeaters themselves have little remains of human sentience, generally little more than gibbering wrecks who have only retained enough sentience to perform raids and ambushes out of the [foglands|E] and kill themselves upon capture. Physically, they possess an unnaturally pale skin from which many of their veins and sometimes even organs can be seen through, and unnaturally spindly and ill-proportioned limbs. Their eyes retain multiple colors not seen in other humans as well, including reds, purples, whites and blacks. Blindness is prevalent, though they seem unnaturally immune to most known sicknesses, and have far less need for food or water in comparison to humans.

They were far superior at [magic|E], bred less, lived longer, and were generally considered far smarter and stronger. While looking similar to humans, they possessed long pointed ears, alien yet exceptionally striking facial features, and shades of skin going from ivory to black to blue.\n\nThe Aelfir's greatest flaw was in their cruelty. Obsessing over their own image and power, the Aelfir regularly brutalized one another and especially humans in attempts to further their own power. [aersanon|E] saw this as a weakness and strove to fix it with a third project, but was stopped by the Godherja and Their apparent death.\n\nThe Aelfir formed multiple empires across the planet before their destruction in the Godherja, from which they reigned for several thousand years with humanity toiling as a brutalized slave caste. After humanity stole their [magic|E] and wiped out the race, they have been almost completely forgotten from history. The closest to memory of the Aelfir is from the [aversarians|E] who worship a pantheon of 'First Men', and the Sjalvolki whose tales of [creatures|E] from the 'Gods Above' contain mentions to Aelfir, though they are considred minor demons and little more than monsters."

Religions and cults have often risen up around these towers, their beliefs reinforced by the powerful [magics|E] radiating off them.\n\nDespite the massive interest in the towers, nobody is known to have ever seen the interior of one, as each is surrounded by a deadly [magical|E] field.\n\nThe most famous of the Towers is the [sea_tower|E] (or the [imperial_tower|E] to [aversarians|E]), which is claimed to have once been the throne of the 'Purest'.

Ferocious and massive reptilian beasts, dragons could breath fire, ice, or poison upon their foes, fly with massive wings, and showed an intelligence at or above a human level. They were capable of complex speech, though only the one(s) they spoke to could seemingly hear their voice. Dragons would come in a variety of colors based on the contents of their breath, and would normally travel in packs of up to six-a mother and father couple and their children, normally splitting once the children either found mates or created their own packs.\n\nDragons were rare but not entirely uncommon in their homelands along the [shattered_coast|E] and it was considered a high honor in Aversarian society to be declared a Dragon Rider upon taming one of the creatures, normally through forming something akin to a friendship with it. The rise of [aversaria|E] coincided—partially due to Aversarian breeding programs—with a marked increase in the dragon population, and by the War of the Thousand Dragons there would be over 800 recorded Dragon Riders belonging to various cliques and fraternities across [aversaria|E].\n\nDragons were seemingly wiped out during and after the war, first from battle and then later after Aautokratir Aexionarax deemed the remaining dragons too dangerous and had them slaughtered.\n\nThe most famous dragon in history was [arthenax|E], commonly believed to be the last living dragon."

In the modern era, Griffon riders are considered somewhat rare, normally limited to royalty and elite units fielded by the [antimagic_orders|E], several of which maintain stables of Griffons and take great pride in breeding the animals. It is tradition for each of the major [antimagic_orders|E] to offer a griffon to a newly coronated monarch.

Those few who have visited its cold interior and lived to tell the tale describe an immense feeling of dread, of constantly being watched and surrounded by a relentless litany of panicked whispers and unnatural sounds. Whatever one fears can be manifested in the [foglands|E], monsters of man's own creation taking corporeal form and attacking them as they wander, and living on to persist to another day.

game_concept_exposure_sickness_desc:0 "Exposure Sickness is a catchall term for a variety of ailments arising to excess exposure to [magical|E] energies. Generally this happens due to proximity to [magical|E] places of power such as ancient temples, wayline crossings or [magical|E] battlefields, but is also found in [magi|E] who gather excess power. It is not to be confused with ailments resulting from casting spells requiring an excess of power than what the caster possesses, which is normally called [overwhelmation|E].\n\nExposure Sickness normally begins with headaches, fevers, dizziness and vomiting. At higher levels of exposure it can manifest in the bleeding of the eyes and nose, vomiting of blood, hair and skin loss, and the sloughing of skin. [mutations|E] are common at heightened levels, and at the highest levels of exposure, it has been reported that the afflicted can disintegrate, spontaneously combust, melt, or quite literally explode, assuming they do not simply expire."

game_concept_overwhelmation:0 "Overwhelmation"
game_concept_overwhelmation_desc:0 "Overwhelmation is the result of [magi|E] attempting to cast spells in excess of what their bodies are physically capable of. Normally the result of rookie [magi|E] unsure of their own limits, or [magi|E] in moments of life or death desperation, Overwhelmation normally results in painful death. Combustion, disintegration or explosion are the most common results, other times the spell they are attempting to cast may backfire upon them or those around them. A blast of fire may simply ignite the [magi|E], attempting to crush an enemy's blood may lead to an explosion of the arms, or attempting to heal a grievous wound to the melting of the [magi|E]'s nervous system.\n\n[aversarian|E] researchers in the [mayikprolollan|E] predicted that approximately up to a third or more of [magi|E] not from a magically gifted family or of unknown birth will die of Overwhelmation after casting a spell by accident or in trying to discover their powers."

The disease is generally agreed to be magical in nature, though its origins are unknown. Victims normally show traits similar to [exposure_sickness|E], most likely due to the disease itself rapidly increasing the levels of magic within the victim. Victims normally show glowing, pulsing red veins, bleed from the nose, eyes and ears, and will normally expire from blood loss after rapid skin loss. If they survive this, then they normally die from the lining of the lungs collapsing, and their chests filling with blood. Bloodblight spreads most rapidly to Magi, though mundane humans are still prone to it.\n\nThe effects of the Bloodblight outbreak of the Seventh Century were massive and longreaching. In [chevalie|E], the first High King in a generation along with his entire extended family were wiped out and the Chevaliens forced to withdraw from their last colonies in the Black Mountains. In Aversaria, an entire generation of the nobility were destroyed, leading to mass societal collapse and a near dissolution of the Aautokrata. In [sarradon|E], the structured and elite magic class (named the Sirhad) were almost entirely destroyed. Without the Sirhad to direct and control magic on the continent, the following generation would throw out most established norms and standards from their predecessors, and begin a rapid arms race to discover new horrifying and powerful spells for war. This would eventually lead to the discovery of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E], and by extension, [frodbrokna|E]."

game_concept_selfreplicating_blood_magic_desc:0 "Self-Replicating Blood Magic is a name for a series of rituals and a spell which is commonly believed to be the most powerful and dangerous spell known to humans. An exceptionally complicated spell, Self-Replicating Blood Magic is only castable by the most powerful of Magi and normally requires numerous others to assist them.\n\nThe spell detonates the target in a massive pillar of flame, and quickly does the same to anyone within the blast radius and beyond, spreading even further to Magi or others with magical properties. While theoretically it can be contained to a specific radius or group, the spell is extremely difficult to control, and there has never been casted in recorded history without the caster rapidly losing control.\n\nThe spell was thought lost after its discovery and use by the competing [sarradonian|E] Qurati and Almadi Magi cabals, who wiped themselves and nearly all of the continent's Magi out in the blast and brought anarchy across [sarradon|E] for nearly a century after. It was later discovered by Legon-Aautokratir Aeschraes and Aautokratia Axiaothea during the [aversarian_civil_war|E]. While both prepared to cast it, only Aeschraes managed to in time, and ended up killing 80% of Aversaria's Magi, nearly half of the population otherwise, and wiped out millions otherwise across the entirety of the world. The pure magical power of the spell and the suffering it caused would open [the_rift|E] and bring forth [frodbrokna|E]."

#GAME TYPES

game_concept_skittish_game:0 "Skittish Game"
game_concept_skittish:0 "Skittish"
game_concept_skittish_uppercase:0 "SKITTISH"
game_concept_skittish_game_desc:0 "Skittish creatures are easily scared and will flee at the first sign of trouble. Though this means they are nearly completely safe and will not fight back if attacked, they are more difficult to hunt down due to their constantly high alertness. They will also never start ambushes."

game_concept_cautious_game:0 "Cautious Game"
game_concept_cautious:0 "Cautious"
game_concept_cautious_uppercase:0 "CAUTIOUS"
game_concept_cautious_game_desc:0 "Cautious game is more acutely concerned with self-preservation than most, and will usually avoid fights unless cornered. Though they might retaliate if given no other out, they will rarely bother to finish a fight, even if it is going in their favor, and instead merely make their escape as soon as possible. They will almost never start ambushes, unless as pre-emptive self defense in rare cases."

game_concept_aggressive_game:0 "Aggressive Game"
game_concept_aggressive:0 "Aggressive"
game_concept_aggressive_uppercase:0 "AGGRESSIVE"
game_concept_aggressive_game_desc:0 "Aggressive creatures have a vested interest in winning a fight once one is started, and will actively start combat with other creatures - either due to predation or intense territoriality. Though possible to scare off if sufficiently wounded, they will not back down easily."

game_concept_unyielding_game:0 "Unyielding Game"
game_concept_unyielding:0 "Unyielding"
game_concept_unyielding_uppercase:0 "UNYIELDING"
game_concept_unyielding_game_desc:0 "Either due to a complete lack of self-preservation instincts, extreme arrogance, or simply the actual inability to flee, unyielding creatures will never try to flee a fight. Though this means that there is no risk of one escaping once tracked down, it also means that the ensuing fight will always be to the death."

game_concept_sedentary_game:0 "Sedentary Game"
game_concept_sedentary:0 "Sedentary"
game_concept_sedentary_uppercase:0 "SEDENTARY"
game_concept_sedentary_game_desc:0 "Sedentary creatures practically never leave a small territory that they consider home. Though this means that they are unlikely to chase after attackers after they retreat, it also makes it significantly harder to track them."

game_concept_fast_game:0 "Fast Game"
game_concept_fast:0 "Fast"
game_concept_fast_uppercase:0 "FAST"
game_concept_fast_game_desc:0 "Fast creatures are capable of notable agility and speed, and are hence more likely to be able to flee once push comes to shove - and are nearly impossible to escape from if they are aggravated. Additionally, due to the vast distances they can usually travel, tracking them takes longer than normal."

game_concept_slow_game:0 "Slow Game"
game_concept_slow:0 "Slow"
game_concept_slow_uppercase:0 "SLOW"
game_concept_slow_game_desc:0 "Some creatures are especially slow or even outright immobile, and hence have a vastly more difficult time making an escape, and cannot pursue their enemies. However, this usually indicates that they have other ways to defend themselves from predation."

game_concept_intelligent_game:0 "Intelligent Game"
game_concept_intelligent:0 "Intelligent"
game_concept_intelligent_uppercase:0 "INTELLIGENT"
game_concept_intelligent_game_desc:0 "Some creatures go well beyond being merely intelligent for an animal, and are simply intelligent - period. They are very possibly sapient and at the intellectual level of a human, or in rare cases, perhaps even higher. Some may even be capable of speech, if they have any interest in dialogue.\n\nWhat this means in practise is that the game is exceptionally difficult to ambush, is far more proficient at ambushing itself, and is far more likely to retreat if it is at a disadvantage compared to the hunter."

game_concept_cunning_game:0 "Cunning Game"
game_concept_cunning:0 "Cunning"
game_concept_cunning_uppercase:0 "CUNNING"
game_concept_cunning_game_desc:0 "Cunning creatures possess remarkable wit and forethrought, and are more difficult to deceive than the average beast. This means that they are far harder to successfully ambush, are more adept at pulling off ambushes themselves, and will actively take into account the strength of a potential hunter when determining whether to fight or flee."

game_concept_stupid_game:0 "Stupid Game"
game_concept_stupid:0 "Stupid"
game_concept_stupid_uppercase:0 "STUPID"
game_concept_stupid_game_desc:0 "Some creatures are exceptionally dim-witted and naive, even for a wild beast. They will blunder into ambushes blissfully unaware, and are incapable of ambushing themselves."

game_concept_huge_game:0 "Huge Game"
game_concept_huge:0 "Huge"
game_concept_huge_uppercase:0 "HUGE"
game_concept_huge_game_desc:0 "Huge game towers over humans, and is likely able to kill with a well placed stomp if need be - presuming they are able to do so, of course. Even if not overtly aggressive, creatures of this size are formidable, but this also means that they are vastly easier to track than normal. Elephants are a good example of game in this category."

game_concept_large_game:0 "Large Game"
game_concept_large:0 "Large"
game_concept_large_uppercase:0 "LARGE"
game_concept_large_game_desc:0 "Large creatures are those that are significantly larger and more massive than the average human, but not to a point where they could be considered truly huge. Bears are a good example of a mundane animal of this size category. Large game is easier to track, but is also usually more formidable in combat."

game_concept_elusive_game:0 "Elusive Game"
game_concept_elusive:0 "Elusive"
game_concept_elusive_uppercase:0 "ELUSIVE"
game_concept_elusive_game_desc:0 "Elusive creatures are not only rare, but difficult to track - their trail can seemingly vanish into nothing in a matter of moments, either as a result of generally leaving little in the way of evidence of their activity, or due to their movement being highly erratic and unpredictable."

game_concept_brazen_game:0 "Brazen Game"
game_concept_brazen:0 "Brazen"
game_concept_brazen_uppercase:0 "BRAZEN"
game_concept_brazen_game_desc:0 "Brazen creatures navigate their environment with utter carelessness and make no effort to conceal their presence. The trails they leave behind are so obvious that even the most novice of hunters can track them with ease."

game_concept_poisonous_game:0 "Poisonous Game"
game_concept_poisonous:0 "Poisonous"
game_concept_poisonous_uppercase:0 "POISONOUS"
game_concept_poisonous_game_desc:0 "Some creatures are able to inflict poisons well beyond what the average human can conceivably survive. They are especially dangerous to hunt, as even what initially seems like a superficial flesh wound can end up killing in a matter of minutes as poison consumes the hapless victim's body."

game_concept_social_game:0 "Social Game"
game_concept_social:0 "Social"
game_concept_social_uppercase:0 "SOCIAL"
game_concept_social_game_desc:0 "Social creatures tend to live in groups, making them generally easier to track at the cost of combat being far more risky - if they are not ambushed, there is a chance that the hunter will be pursued at the conclusion of a fight, regardless of success. [skittish|E] creatures will never pursue, and [cautious|E] will only pursue if [intelligent|E] to retaliate in the event of one of their own being killed."

game_concept_emanates_magic_game:0 "Magic-Emanating Game"
game_concept_emanates_magic:0 "Emanates [magic|E]"
game_concept_emanates_magic_uppercase:0 "EMANATES MAGIC"
game_concept_emanates_magic_game_desc:0 "Some creatures emanate dangerous amounts of ambient [magic|E] into their surroundings. Though this means they are almost trivial to track for [magi|E], scaling with their skill, it also means that there is a reasonable risk of [exposure_sickness|E] when fighting one." 

game_concept_moonbound_game:0 "Aervalr-Bound Game"
game_concept_moonbound:0 "Aervalr-Bound"
game_concept_moonbound_uppercase:0 "AERVALR-BOUND"
game_concept_moonbound_game_desc:0 "The phases of [aervalr|E] are a potent source of [dead_magic|E] across the world, and it is unsurprising that some creatures' strength waxes and wanes together with Aeras' moon. When the moon is dim, these creatures are more likely to be reclusive and weaker, while conversely being more aggressive and stronger when Aervalr shines bright."

game_concept_merit_desc:0 "The [marchers|E], though ostensibly feudal, are rarely keen to follow those deemed unfit to rule. Historically, those exceptionally skilled in the arts of warfare and politics were often able to displace elder heirs from the line of succession and take the throne from themselves, especially if the heir in question was weak.
