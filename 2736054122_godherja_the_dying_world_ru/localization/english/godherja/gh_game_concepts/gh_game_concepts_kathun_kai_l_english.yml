game_concept_iorne_seld:0 "Iorne Seld"
game_concept_iorne_seld_desc:0 "The Iorne Seld, or 'Sword of Eons' in the Öltenic languages, is the legendary sword of the Öltenic warlord Otached, who united the Öltenic clans into the [iorne_horde|E] and brought them south to Kashirya after the [khayar_seldnii_darn|E] and its clash with the almost as legendary blade [eyon_faeng|E] during Otached's duel with the Kathuni Xaoi Yaung Zayang, which caused an explosion that destroyed the state of Cheyyungjei. The sword was of utterly unknown make if tales are to be believed. Otached is first to have discovered it after slaying a great dragon, whose gaping maw opened a portal to a distant realm, from which Otached pulled the legendary sword and beheaded the beast, forever sealing the portal.\n\nDespite some doubt from Aversarian scholars about the veracity of the sword, the tale of the legendary blade seems to predate that of Otached's discovery of it, leading to a plethora of conclusions from the belief that Otached faked the blade to legitimize his rule to the possibility he truly did find an ancient sword that had already entered Öltenic legend. Öltenic mythology claimed that the sword was the blade of Ölik, son of Ölgon-ten, chief god of the Öltenic pantheon, who came to [aeras|E] as the first human before being killed by the earth goddess Yeru-Mai. Whether the true blade or fake, its finding or the belief in its authenticity allowed Otached to greatly legitimize his rule and was instrumental in his unification of the Öltenic clans.\n\nThe blade passed to his son Ayran in the later [otachedian_empire|E] and then to his son Baytor, who led the Öltenis west into Aironoi during the [bayyuralar|E], where he drowned in a creek after being thrown from his horse, the sword being washed away into the nearby river and then to the sea. While many Öltenic nomads and Aversarian explorers have attempted to locate it, the location of Baytor's death has become lost to time, and the veracity of the sword has remained in question."
game_concept_eyon_faeng:0 "Eyon Faeng"
game_concept_eyon_faeng_desc:0 "Eyon Faeng, or 'Whispering Wind' in the ruling language of Kathun-Kai, is a legendary sword and perhaps the most well-known Kathuni fable, bastardized tales of the sword and its history reaching as far as Chevalie even before the people of [the_continent|E] made contact with the far-east. Despite its legendary status across the world, however, it was lost some time before the 4th century and never recovered or seen again. The last known wielder of the blade was the Kathuni First Master of the First Banner to the Emperor, Xaoi Yaung Zayang, who led nearly 100,000 men into battle in the [khayar_seldnii_darn|E] against the Öltenic warlord Otached and wielder of the eequally famous blade [iorne_seld|E].\n\nThe blade itself is said to have been as thin as paper, but was impervious to so much as a scratch and gave its wielder the ability to swing far faster than any human should be capable of. Not only that, but many legends refer to it 'cutting the air itself'. While recorded many times in the Kathuni bureaucratic record, the actual result or veracity of this is unncertain. Almost all tales of the blade doing so refer to it as tearing through vision itself, leaving horrifying black voids in reality and tearing down the walls of castles and cities before it.\n\nThe sword was originally claimed to have been the fifth blade of the first Empress of Kathun-Kai, Dragon Empress Yao Ren Cai-Tiayang, and was gifted to her legendary bodyguard (and founding First Master of the First Banner to the Emperor) Gaorun Mayng who would then pass it down to each successive First Master. Xaoi Yaung Zayang, after his stalemate with Otached, disappeared after the devastation of the battle. While unproven, tales say he became a Xaouxae (a traveling swordsman) after abandoning the Emperor's service in shame. Regardless, with Yaung Zayang's disappearance from the historical record, Whispering Wind too was never seen again."

game_concept_khayar_seldnii_darn:0 "Khayar Seldnii Darn"
game_concept_khayar_seldnii_darn_desc:0 "The Khayar Seldnii Darn, or 'Two Swords War' in the Öltenic languages, was a legendary conflict between the Öltenic warlord Otached and the Kathuni general Xaoi Yaung Zayang, First Master of the First Banner to the Emperor and the last of the major [oltenic_kathuni_wars|E]. The war itself is named for the swords each general wielded for the conflict, Otached holding the legendary [iorne_seld|E] and Yaung Zayang the equally legendary [eyon_faeng|E]. It began when Otachad gathered a large force and smashed through the Kathuni border forts despite being outnumbered nearly three to one before sacking the city of Haoj'an, capital of the western state of Cheyyungjei.\n\nYaung Zayang, whose motives are different in most modern tellings of the story (most frequently stories say that either his brother was slain defending the border forts or his family was slaughtered in Haoj'an), requested permission from then-Emperor Xu Giang-Xu Yaon to take his personal banner west to slay the Öltenic warlord and find a way to permanently end the increasing Öltenic threat. Most likely remembering the [gayhan_campaign|E] which had brought the Öltenis within viewing distance of the capital only thirty years prior during his father's reign, (the Öltenis being allowed to view the capital at all, even from afar, being seen as a devastating insult to the Emperor's lineage) he approved and sent a force of his personal [magi|E] to accompany him.\n\nWhile Otached faced a terrible defeat in the Battle of Kayang, he managed to escape across the Kathuni border where he used the spreading legend of his blade and his personal connections to other clans to gather the greatest host ever brought against the Kathuni, uniting almost all major Öltenic clans into a great host which soon fought and routed Yaung Zayang. Yaung Zayang, now under threat of death if he were to fail again, returned with three full Banners as well as the militia of four different states. The war ended with the [battle_of_kayarang|E]."
game_concept_battle_of_kayarang:0 "Battle of Kayarang"
game_concept_battle_of_kayarang_desc:0 "The Battle of Kayarang was the closing engagement of the [khayar_seldnii_darn|E]. Taking place at the hills of Kayarang, the largest army ever raised by an Öltenic khatan at that point met with three full Banners of the Emperor of Kathun-Kai along with the militia of four different states. At the head of the Öltenic forces was Khatan Otached, while leading the Kathuni forces was Xaoi Yaung Zayang, the most formidable warrior of Emperor Xu Giang-Xu Yaon. Hoping to take advantage of the hilly terrain, Xaoi Yaung Zayang positioned himself for combat at Kayarang while he had one of his generals, Huo He, lead a full Banner to engage the Öltenic horde, then feign a retreat to Kayarang.\n\nOtached and his horde pursued the retreating Kathuni, where they were ambushed by Yaung Zayang's forces. In the ensuing battle, both Otached and Yaung Zayang chanced upon each other in combat, though some records romanticize this and claim that they challenged each other to mortal combat, breaking the fighting and obeying the proper rules of dueling. In the chaos of the combat, both of their legendary swords clashed and produced an explosion which desolated not just Kayarang, but its parent state of Cheyyungjei as well. While Yaung Zayang and Otached survived, only a few hundred of their combined forces were left alive at the end of the battle.\n\nOtached later went on to unify the Öltenis under his banner, using the legend of his sword - the [iorne_seld|E] - to bring most of the clans under his banner. Yaung Zayang, meanwhile, left the Emperor's service in shame and wandered the world as a Xaouxae, a sort of wandering mercenary swordsman, taking with him the legendary [eyon_faeng|E]. Huo He, another survivor, committed suicide in order to protect both his honor and the honor of his family. The battle has lived on in infamy for both the people of Kathun-Kai and the Öltenic nomads, though in Öltenic versions of the tale it is portrayed more romantically."
game_concept_oltenic_kathuni_wars:0 "Öltenic-Kathuni Wars"
game_concept_oltenic_kathuni_wars_desc:0 "The Öltenic-Kathuni Wars refers to several centuries of war that ocurred between the nomadic proto-Öltenic (primarily taking place prior to the modern inception of their cultures and faiths) clans of the northeastern Kolrgii Steppes and the Empire of Kathun-Kai, the conflict mainly in the steppes and frontiers between the homelands of the Katharaddi and Kathun-Kai itself.\n\nWhile the wars were fought by cultures so old to predate even the relatively ancient Öltenis, most of them are well known between Öltenic oral tradition and Kathun-Kai's obsessively prolific bureaucracy. The majority of the recorded conflicts consisted of border skirmishes, normally Öltenic raids pushing deeper and deeper into the Kathuni frontier until either being met by Kathuni Imperial Army forces or hired mercenaries.\n\nSeveral of the wars instead ended with the Öltenis forming a great horde that managed to reach deep into the Kathuni heartlands to directly threaten their capital, while others ended with the Kathuni attempting to permanently build forts and settle in the Kolrgii Steppes to prevent further conflict. The wars were never conclusive until the legendary [khayar_seldnii_darn|E] led to a massive Öltenic exodus from the steppes into Kashirya. While several tribes remained and would repopulate the steppes, the conflicts with the Kathuni would never reach the regularity they had before, and are generally classified separately."
game_concept_gayhan_campaign:0 "Gayhan Campaign"
game_concept_gayhan_campaign_desc:0 "The Gayhan Campaign was a proto-Öltenic invasion of Kathun-Kai taking place during the [oltenic_kathuni_wars|E] thirty years prior to the [khayar_seldnii_darn|E] which largely ended them. The Campaign itself started as little more than a minor raid by the steppe warlord Oarachad, who rode east with less than a thousand horsemen.\n\nDespite a small start, utter failure among the Kathuni forces in the western state of Cheyyungjei saw the raiding horde balloon in size and allowed them to easily punch through to the richest and historically more secure heartlands of Kathun-Kai. After the death of Governor Mai Chao of the state of Iayan, Kathuni militia forces collapsed and the Öltenis conquered the entirety of the states that sat on the Gayhan Road, the empire's main trade-route.\n\nEmperor Xu Yaon-Xu Wu, whom had been too afeared of the increasingly infamous Oarachad, was finally stirred to action when he realized he was able to spot the camping Öltenic horde from his capital in [loen_chaeon|E]. This was a grievous and humiliating insult to the Emperor, Kathuni tradition saying only those pure of spirit and blood who properly supplicated before the Emperor's representatives could even view the beautiful and ancient city. Risking a coup due to his humiliation, Emperor Xu Yaon ordered his First, Second, Third and Fifth personal Banners to strike against Oarachad, the first time he had risked using his personal forces. The following battle would see Oarachad slain and his horde shattered, but greatly destabilize the Kathun-Kai political scene and was a major cause of the [qinianxa_panulan|E] and the eventual [khayar_seldnii_darn|E]."
game_concept_qinianxa_panulan:0 "Qiniānxà Pànulàn"
game_concept_qinianxa_panulan_desc:0 "Qiniānxà Pànulàn, or 'Thousand Summer Rebellion', was an exceptionally devastating series of rebellions across western Kathun-Kai by both the philosopher-led Sēn'do Wa ('Esoteric' in Kathuni) peasant movement and Emperor Xu Yaon-Xu Wu's sisters, Xu Chuha and Xu Baohang who would later be referred to as the Linang bè Tāshǐng, or 'Two Angels', after being immortalized as folk-heroes.\n\nThe first seeds of rebellion were planted with the grave humiliation struck against Xu Yaon by the warlord Oarachad in the [gayhan_campaign|E], which caused a rapid deteoration in Xu Yaon's already shaky political standing and put his existence as reincarnation of the Dragon Empress (and first ruler of modern Kathun-Kai) Yao Ren Cai-Tiayang in doubt among the nobility and scholarly classes. While Xu Yaon desperately tried to rectify this by announcing a five year long period of festivities and feasts to celebrate 'his' victory over Oarachad, a famine caused by a poor growing season, the incompetence of the newly emplaced Governor Mai Chao in Iayan and damage to the farmlands from the Gayhan Campaign led to a terrible famine that would soon see thousands death.\n\nWith the peasantry furious that the Emperor feasted and celebrated while they starved, the long turbulent Sēn'do Wa philosophers fanned the flames and convinced the peasantry to join them in an uprising against Xu Yaon's rule, declaring that the Emperor could never be reincarnated from Yao Ren as they had preached for decades. The chaos led to an attempted palace coup by Xu Yaon's sisters along with their personal Fifth and Sixth Banners, and while it failed, they soon retreated north where they earned the loyalty of the states of Piyaon, Zhozhu and Wen who declared the sisters the true co-empresses of Kathun-Kai and joined their rebellion.\n\nIt took over twenty years for the Thousand Summer Rebellion to reach its end, bitter fighting leaving greatly damaging the west and north and the fighting only slowing when Xu Yaon was (allegedly) murdered by his personal sculptor. The two sisters attempted to then take their throne, but were betrayed by Governor Pu Yan of the State of Zhozhu, who had Xu Chuha murdered, with Xu Baohang being forced to go into hiding after being betrayed by her bribed soldiers. Xu Yaon's nephew Xu Giang, his favored and only sixteen years old, is said to have tricked the Fifth and Sixth Banners to believe that he had been declared Emperor and then marched in at their head. The panicked regents of [loen_chaeon|E] opened the gates to him, and he was quickly crowned. Following this, the year's harvest proved to be extremely bountiful, and this along with many public works programs calmed the turbulent peasantry and led to them naming him 'Shàlán de Lóen', or 'Kind Dragon'. The Thousand Summer Rebellion is said to have fully ended when Xu Giang offered his aunt his hand in marriage. Xu Baohong accepted, but upon entering within Lóen Chaéon, is said to have been 'murdered by a thousand servants with a thousand knives', at Xu Giang's order.\n\nThe Thousand Summer Rebellion would kill over 200000 Kathuni soldiers and citizens, and greatly changed Kathun-Kai's political organization between the general destruction and Xu Giang's reforms which attempted to head off similar events. The Rebellion would soon be followed by the [khayar_seldnii_darn|E], the western horselord Otached using the chaos to launch his great raid east. Most importantly to the historical record, Xu Giang's great fear at following his predecessors legacy was likely the greatest reasoning for his immediate and large response to Otached."

game_concept_loen_chaeon:0 "Lóen Chaéon"
game_concept_loen_chaeon_desc:0 "Lóen Chaéon, or 'Dragon City' in Kathuni, is the capital from which every legitimate ruler of Kathun-Kai has ruled since the polity's inception with Dragon Empress Yao Ren Cai. Despite little of ancient Lóen Chaéon remaining in its modern incarnation (even its original name being lost to history), it has been one of the east's largest cities for at least several thousand years before the birth of Yao Ren Cai. Often called the 'greatest of cities' or 'city in which the world sits' by Kathuni scholars due to its grandeur, reports of it were met with doubt by [aversarian|E] scholars who heard the tales before their first attempts to journey east. When [magi|E] and cartographer Eothos Aethacros became the first Aversarian allowed to not only see, but enter the city, he immediately wrote over thirty pages in his letter home describing his amazement at the city's grandeur, claiming the myth's were not true but actually greatly downplayed.\n\nThe city itself stretches across the entirety of the isle of Daogao and is centered around an inert [tower|E] that over centuries of development has slowly dissapeared beneath a massive facade of Kathuni architecture. While originally a large settlement near the tower linking down to a smaller port, subsequent rulers have built a city stretching across an island roughly the size of the Imperial Isle of startlingly impressive architecture, endless amounts of monuments and fountains, and over a hundred gardens and parks the size of most cities. Some Aversarians have noted that by Aethacros's description, it was likely most of the city was infact uninhabited, and that the 'gardens' and 'parks' that dominated over half of the island existed due to the impossibility of building a city so large.\n\nKathuni law has the penalty for observing the capital, even from the sea or across the straits, to be a crime worthy of death or blinding. Kathuni merchants traveling through the trade centers around the tributaries that feed into the Bay of Ren Cai are required to either blindfold themselves or remain below-decks while passing the city, normally having their ships guided by local sailors from the emperor's retinue for a hefty fine. Shipping not effected as such belong to the Imperial Holy Merchant Fleet, captains and sailors personally ordained as priests by the emperor's servants to allow thme to pilot massive barges that dwarf most warships past the city. Despite its grandeur and the mythologization in Kathuni culture, however, the last scattered fragments of information that has traveled west along the now-silent merchant routes speak of the city being in great crisis. A magical blast from the formerly inert tower at its center (occurring simultaneously with [frodbrokna|E] seemingly summoning forth a great host of monstrosities that have occupied the empty portions of the capital. The district in which the emperor and their servants dwell is now perpetually under siege, and attempts by their Banners to liberate the now eldritch streets have been disastrous."

##FAITHS

game_concept_kathuni_dragon_mythology:0 "Kathuni Dragon Mythology"
game_concept_kathuni_dragon_mythology_desc:0 "The mythologization of the [dragon|E] in Kathuni lore and religion is incredibly intricate and often outright esoteric to most outside observers who have attempted to learn the culture. While most likely inspired by the actual historical creature, the Kathuni deification of the beast puts them far above in importance to even the similarly dragon-focused [aversarians|E]. While some scholars have theorized the mundane explanation may have been a dragon (or dragons) either devastating or ruling over an ancient pre-Empire Kathun-Kai, the actual veracity of this is impossible to be known due to missing sections of Kathun-Kai's otherwise extremely well documented historical record.\n\nSome four hundred years before the formation of [aversaria|E], an exceptionally power [magi|E] named Yao Ren Cai would overthrow the Theocratic Monastic-Princely Orders that dominated the east and crown herself first Empress of Kathun-Kai and take the predecessorial name 'Tiayang' ('Sun' or 'Heaven' in Kathuni) before allegedly ruling for two hundred years and crafting 'Fourteen Heavenly Ways of Life' by which to achieve perfection spiritually, physically, and mentally. Upon her death in her capital of [loen_chaeon|E], either because of propagandizing by Yao Ren Cai, mythologization of her legacy or truth in Kathuni belief, she would be declared to have joined with the gods and merged with them to become the 'First Dragon' (Kathuni belief specifies that while mundane dragons may have existed prior, she became a far greater version).\n\nWhile this belief is only primarily held by the aristocracy, the commoners of Kathun-Kai instead more regularly believing she actually became the sky and earth, it has nonetheless greatly shaped Kathun-Kai's culture moving forward and especially that of its nobility. Yao Ren Cai's son, Emperor Yao Lingxu-Yao Ren Cai, would declare himself the reincarnation of the First Dragon to secure his right to rule and would be followed in this by every Emperor after him. The ruling religion of the east (often referred to in the west as the 'Fourteen Heavenly Methods') that formed during and after Yao Ren Cai would further push the belief in dragon by encouraging worship of the First Dragon and all of its reincarnations as the 'spiritual center' of Kathun-Kai and as a method to maintain support of the monarchy. While the belief in the monarchy's reincarnation remains mixed, the worship of dragons (and Yao Ren Cai) would nonetheless dominate Kathun-Kai for the rest of its history."
