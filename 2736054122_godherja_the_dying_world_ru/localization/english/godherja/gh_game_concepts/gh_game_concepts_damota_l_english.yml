game_concept_pre_boqqarut_damota_desc:0 "Prior to the rise of the [boqqarut|E] under Eshwo, the people of Damota were clustered around the great lakes and rivers that wound through the jungle, with a variety of semi-tribal realms fighting over the land. Much of the deep jungle remained unexplored, and tales were told of what was concealed within. Of particular note is the idea of the Corpse, which held that an ancient god had been slain and laid to rest within the jungle, along with other practices such as ritual exploration and jungle burials. This period would come to an end with the rise of the Boqqarut in 258 IS, when the major tribes were unified under a single banner for the first time."

game_concept_etami_tetenik:0 "Etami Tetenik"
game_concept_etami_tetenik_desc:0 "Beginning in 861 IS with the death of Boqqar Kayoba, the Etami Tetenik was the convoluted succession struggle turned catastrophic civil war that brought the [boqqarut|E] to ruin. With no obvious heir, the succession began as a traditional [tetenik|E], with a variety of major and minor claimants raising armies and marching towards Zahali. However, unlike in the past, open conflict erupted after a one-year standoff, with the armies led by Falor and Dabok, both powerful noblemen, meeting in open battle at the gates of the capital, soon spilling over into the city. Though Dabok would emerge victorious, he would crown himself Boqqar while gazing upon the wreckage of Zahali. \n\nOf course, this reign was not to last, and a combined army of multiple claimants would march on the city within a few months, deposing him, after which their coalition would collapse into infighting itself. While chaos gripped the heartlands, the edges of the empire began to slip away, as basically anyone with command of a handful of men proclaimed themselves Boqqar, and either marched towards the capital or began carving their own realms out of the collapsing [boqqarut|E]. In several regions, with external authority having disappeared completely, the [lodges|E] became the sole beacons of order, while in others, pre-collapse nobility formed their own kingdoms from the ashes of the [boqqarut|E]. Though the war over Zahali would continue for about a decade, Damota had collapsed in on itself, and the age of warlords would soon consolidate into one of minor realms, with the once-unified region split between a number of rulers and states."

game_concept_ayule_expedition:0 "Ayule's Expedition"
game_concept_ayule_expedition_desc:0 "Ayule’s Expedition, as it is known to history, is the sole example of the [boqqarut|E]’s armies invading lands beyond Damota, attempting to claim the other side of the Gonan Road and the metropolis of Kudahar in the chaos of Sarradon after [halakdun|E]. The Expedition was launched in 821 IS, and rapidly seized the strategic Road itself and many of the northern lands. At first, it seemed like a great triumph, with the fragmentary warlords unable to stand against the organized armies of Damota. Even to later historians, the initial campaign is seen as the crowning achievement of the [boqqarut|E]’s forces throughout the state’s long history. \n\nThe war, however, would not go down as a triumph. Though the great city of Kudahar fell in 823 IS, and military rule had been implemented across the conquered territories, further advances were stalled, and the mission shifted to securing the already-conquered territories from the increasing levels of both native resistance and nomadic raids. The warlords of the region had scorched the earth prior to their defeat, and the desert’s inhabitants would repeatedly harass caravans crossing the Gonan Road, rendering Ayule’s Expedition increasingly dependent on harsh methods of extracting wealth, and whatever supplies could be carried through the desert. \n\nAt home, the Damotan state itself was increasingly indebted to the rich nobility and [karavuux|E], draining the treasury to pay for its increasingly disastrous ambition. Though the occupation would last until 829 IS, the Expedition would be ousted after the Battle of Lazzan, when a coalition of local warlords, nomads, and peasant rebels would overwhelm the Damotan armies, forcing a humiliating retreat across the desert, after which Ayule withdrew his forces across the Gonan Road. All that his Expedition had won for his flagging [zalreb_dynasty|E] was debt, and their armies had been left as hollowed shells. Many, in fact, blame the fall of the [boqqarut|E] and the [etami_tetenik|E] on the crushing defeat of this invasion, with its failure effectively ending the Boqqar’s ability to control anything beyond Zahali itself."

game_concept_karururi_chorus:0 "Karururī Chorus"
game_concept_karururi_chorus_desc:0 "Held in 254 IS, the Karururī Chorus was a conference of many of the greatest holy men of [pre_boqqarut_damota|E]. Hosted by the soon-to-be Boqqar Eshwo, the task of this great dialogue was to piece together the truth of the world from the teachings of several faiths. This conference is considered the foundational moment for the Mogowai religion that would soon spread through Damota.\n\nDespite the near-mythic status it holds in the present as part of the narrative of the [boqqarut|E]'s rise, the Chorus was in reality a deeply divisive event. Multiple individual priests, and eventually entire groups, walked out of the room as the unification of faiths began cutting parts that were found contradictory. Perhaps the most controversial of the many rulings of this body was the declaration that the world's god was dead, which prompted an exodus of priests to flee Eshwo's realm, where they would continue to fight the Boqqarut during the [war_of_songs|E]. When the Chorus ended, it presented to Eshwo two things. First, the Hymns of Heaven, the combined and edited songs recording the story and doctrine of the new faith. But second came his burden. As He Who Was Most High was dead, it was up to Eshwo to become a steward over His people, and lead them to the rediscovery of His lost tomb, making him the first Kihinet of the Mogowai."

game_concept_war_of_songs:0 "The War of Songs"
game_concept_war_of_songs_desc:0 "The War of Songs was the first conflict in the history of the [boqqarut_damotada|E], though it began prior to the polity's formation. Following a walkout of the [karururi_chorus|E] in response to the proclamation that god was dead, a second, "true" Chorus was held in Busemdo, calling all of the righteous to stand with them against the dangerous heretic Eshwo and his puppet Chorus. These Busemdowai, as they were named by history, followed this declaration with the drafting and promulgation of their own, rival doctrine. Though initially dismissed by Eshwo, the opportunity to perhaps save their threatened realms was not missed by his many rivals, and several Damotan chieftains had soon pledged their spears to this cause.\n\nNow assailed on multiple fronts, Eshwo chose to pursue a defensive strategy, splitting off large contingents of his numerically-superior forces to hold the northwestern and eastern Busemdowai armies while he focused the bulk of his forces on the south, hoping to wheel around from enemy to enemy. This strategy, though threatened by a sudden breakthrough by one of his rivals in early 257, largely proved effective, as the realm which would soon become the [boqqarut|E] utilized its central position to keep its enemies divided.\n\nAfter crushing the south and northwest seperately, and either replacing or obtaining binding oaths from their leaders, Eshwo successfully captured Isurwa by way of treason among the enemy ranks, and forced the Busemdo Chorus to flee once more. After his capture of all of the traditionally-inhabited regions of Damota, Eshwo called all the leaders of the region on the shore of the central Etami Biyaki, where each embraced the Mogowai faith and swore fealty to Eshwo as their Boqqar, officially beginning the history of the [boqqarut_damotada|E]. Nonetheless, despite this apparent defeat, the Busemdo Chorus was not done with its fight, however, and fled into the depths of the jungle to continue resisting the rise of the Mogowai, only being finally put down in 306 IS."

game_concept_lodges_desc:0 "The Lodges of Damota are one of the most crucial aspects of the region's cultural identity, being deeply integrated into the lives of many of Damota's inhabitants. Interestingly, they were first founded in 572 IS as the Rayakuux Orders, a group of Mogowai religious organizations with the goal of seeking out the location of the Most High's corpse. Though initially bound to this purpose, the decline in central authority characteristic to the later history of the [boqqarut|E] would result in their increasing independence from control. Gradually, as the Boqqar's grip on them weakened, they became divided by old tribal allegiances, allegiances which they gradually began to replace. As their power grew, they quickly became embroiled in politics, playing a critical role in the Second [tetenik|E], and would begin to specialize around specific practices. The Orders were officially reorganized in 682 IS, splitting into four categorizations, [rayakuux|E], which maintained the original mission, [karavuux|E], which morphed into mercantile organizations, [waranuux|E], which became focused around the arts of battle, and [qabuux|E], which effectively changed into greater clan or familial structures. The reasons for this massive divergence were political, with these associations growing massively in membership, and shifting their goals to accomodate and encourage this growth. However, to overgeneralize these groups as being merely four lodges would be inaccurate, as each categorization is itself composed of a massive variance of groups, each varied in their own specifics. \n\nIn modern Damota, the four groupings of lodges have become deeply integrated into everyday life, with the majority of the region's population being members, and the organizations themselves having massive influence on the actions of rulers. In fact, to many, their local lodge is a more important authority than whomever they are a subject of."

Born alongside the Mogowai faith, its rulership was always tied to the faith. After the first [tetenik|E], the Mesirs were succeeded by the [olani_dynasty|E], who would complete the project of expansion over the Damotan jungles. Often considered to have reigned over Damota's golden age, the Olanis would take several actions that would forever shape Damota's future, first and foremost being the creation of the [rayakuux_orders|E]. Ironically, these orders would play a role in their downfall in the Second [tetenik|E], which resulted in the rise of the [belar_dynasty|E], under whom the Boqqarut marched onwards, slowly stagnating as the [rayakuux_orders|E] split apart and became ingrained into Damotan society.\n\nThe last line to rule Damota was the [zalreb_dynasty|E], who ascended to the throne in the Third [tetenik|E], and would desperately cling to power as the state dwindled. After the tragedy of [ayule_expedition|E], the Boqqarut's authority verged on collapse, and Kayoba, the final Boqqar, would struggle to retain control before his death in 861 IS, plunging the dying state into the fires of the [etami_tetenik|E]."

game_concept_mesir_dynasty:0 "Mesir Dynasty"
game_concept_mesir_dynasty_desc:0 "The reign of the Mesir Dynasty began with that of the [boqqarut|E], with both having been founded by Eshwo, in addition to the first codified Mogowai faith. Eshwo's unification of Damota under himself occured due to a combination of factors, chief among them the backing of his new priesthood, who greatly assisted in controlling the expanding state. Eshwo would fight a series of wars in his conquest, culminating in 258 IS with his proclamation of the [boqqarut|E], after his victory in the [war_of_songs|E]. His reign would continue for decades, during which the city of Zahali would rise from a minor town to a grand metropolis, gaining a reputation as the shining jewel of his new empire. \n\nUpon his death in 297 IS, he would be succeeded by his second son, Letanya, who utilized his diplomatic prowess skillfully to maintain his father's empire. Though several vassal chiefdoms attempted to break away, Letanya managed to form a cohesive front against them, crushing the rebellions and establishing a more centralized state. His successors, though far less well-remembered, were remarkable for their focus on expanding the state, conquering or colonizing massive swaths of previously-unmapped jungle, and integrating these new regions into the state. Their reign would end in 497 IS, when the widely-detested Boqqar Falwi was murdered, beginning the First [tetenik|E], after which they would be replaced by the [olani_dynasty|E]."

game_concept_olani_dynasty:0 "Olani Dynasty"
game_concept_olani_dynasty_desc:0 "Ascending to the throne after the First [tetenik|E], the Olani Dynasty, founded by Boqqar Zekun in 497, were the second to rule the [boqqarut|E], replacing the [mesir_dynasty|E]. Zekun, though generally considered a more-than competent ruler, spent the majority of his reign consolidating his own power, preventing the Boqqarut from shattering and winning the loyalty of many powerful figures within it, especially the church. As a result of this critical support, the Olani would fund massive expansions into the jungle, searching for the corpse of the Most High. Though begun under Zekun, the bulk of this expansion occured under Boqqara Kelwer, whose settlement programs were largely successful in exerting control over much of the remaining jungle. In addition, the Ḥāseti Mekab was discovered during her reign, and was quickly rebuilt as a temple to the Mogowai faith. \n\nOf course, the most important action taken by the Olani would come in 572 IS, when Boqqar Datesh founded the [rayakuux_orders|E], attempting to build his religious authority to combat the Marefai, a rising movement for a decentralized church. These Orders would be successful initially, with many finding hope in their holy quest to discover the Most High's remains. However, with Datesh's death, central control over the [rayakuux_orders|E] began to wane, and they increasingly became involved in local politics. This would critically factor into the Second [tetenik|E], when the Olanis would be replaced by the rising [belar_dynasty|E]."

game_concept_belar_dynasty:0 "Belar Dynasty"
game_concept_belar_dynasty_desc:0 "Rising in 667 IS under Raloka, often considered the last great Boqqar due to the grand works constructed during his reign, the Belars came to power due partly to support from the rapidly-transforming [rayakuux_orders|E]. Under Raloka's watch, the city of Zahali was transformed and expanded, in addition to a number of monuments and temples constructed across Damota. Of course, his most impressive accomplishment was the construction of the Betami Deqiira, a vast roadway connecting the far ends of the [boqqarut|E]'s territories, which rapidly became a key artery of Damotan trade. Upon his death in 712 IS, the throne passed to his heir, Boqqar Hijal, who would have to face the price of his father's lavish expenditures. \n\nIn an attempt to pay for these debts, Hijal granted yet more extensive priviledges to the newly-split [lodges|E], in exchange for their assistance in covering these costs. However, the erosion of traditional noble priviledges in favor of these rising local authorities resulted in aristocratic discontent, and the majority of his reign was spent walking a tightrope, attempting to placate both groups, even as the [lodges|E] increasingly came to dominate the lives of Damota's people, beginning a monumental cultural shift. This massive erosion of the [boqqarut|E]'s authority, however, meant that when Hijal died in 743 IS, a Third [tetenik|E] ensued, with the Belars being replaced with the [zalreb_dynasty|E], and his heirs fled to the countryside."

game_concept_zalreb_dynasty:0 "Zalreb Dynasty"
game_concept_zalreb_dynasty_desc:0 "Beginning in 746 IS with Boqqar Belora, the Zalrebs ascended after the Third [tetenik|E], and were the last dynasty to rule the [boqqarut|E]. Compared to the soaring accomplishments of their predecessors, the accomplishments of the Zalrebs are generally considered insignificant, with Belora and his descendents overseeing the conclusion of the [boqqarut|E]'s decline. Their rule was one of declining authority, with the [lodges|E] and nobles entering into open political struggles, barely contained by Belora and his successors, who skillfully managed to prevent the withering structures of the state from collapsing. With Belora's death in 773 IS, it seemed that another [tetenik|E] would soon begin, however his son Raleri was able to ascend relatively easily, with many other claimants having been mysteriously murdered. \n\nHis involvement, though never confirmed, became a widespread rumor, and in order to compensate for his lack of popularity, he would begin ruling by fear. Many of his notable opponents disappeared mysteriously, and most were too scared to move against him. However, his allegedly-murderous policies (which he maintained until his death were mere coincidence), meant that his son, Ayule, was able to inheirit rather easily in 817 IS. Ayule is famous for a single action, an action which would demolish almost all vestiges of the [boqqarut|E]'s power. For he would launch [ayule_expedition|E], an invasion of the north which would end disasterously, leaving Ayule in deep debt to a network of [karavuux|E] and nobles, and shattering the core of the Damotan army. Upon his death in 835 IS, the mantle of Boqqar passed to his son Kayoba, who would largely continue this ineffectiveness, his reign plagued with insubordination until his heirless death in 861, marking the end of the [boqqarut|E], with the succession struggle boiling over into the [etami_tetenik|E]."

Generally, a karavuux is considered to contain every person who works within it, or who forms a part of their supply chain. A farmer is a member, as a portion of his food is sold to the traders. An artisan is a member, as their goods are carried upon the karavuux. The king is a member, for their power comes from the wealth of the karavuux. The numbers of the karavuux are impossible to count, though there are only a small handful who can be considered to hold true political influence, with most merely sitting on the sidelines. Due to their extensive memberships, karavuux will often engage in financial skirmishes over disputed towns or supply stations, offering sometimes lavish incentives to the inhabitants to join them, while in other locations exploiting the territories for every last coin."

However, in contrast to their predecessors, the rayakuux have no central structure, instead being a broad categorization for a massive number of separate groups, many of which maintain their own traditions and rules. Though dedicated to adventure, the majority of a rayakuux's members will most likely remain stationary for most of their lives, generally undertaking only a handful of great journeys throughout their lives. Instead, their role is one of assitance, helping their fellow travelers, and offering safe haven for other members. Larger rayakuux commonly also maintain more centralized structures, employing armed guards and compiling knowledge of their journies, often building up generations of knowledge, with some rayakuux dedicated entirely to scholarly pursuits."

Having taken root amongst the rural people of Damota, the qabuux dramatically shifted over the centuries, transitioning into clanlike associations. Multiple families will form a qabuux, generally constructing a large central building in which to live, surrounded by a sizable communal farm. Within the qabuux, bonds are tight, and other members are considered to be family members. While many are little more than single buildings surrounded by crops, others have grown massively, with multiple outbuildings and vast expansions onto the original structure, with some even having spawned towns nearby. \n\nThe relations between qabuux are convoluted, with an ever-shifting network of alliances, rivalries, and negotiations forming a miniature replica of feudal politics, and their role within the lives of those surrounding them cannot be understated."

Though these organizations existed prior to the [etami_tetenik|E], their power and influence skyrocketed as the [boqqarut|E] fell, with their numbers swelling immensely. Though their memberships might seem large at first, the large majority of people within them are not active, rather forming a sort of "reserve" after a period of training over a few years. The cores of these groups are instead composed of a small number, who are mainly tasked with the training and oversight of members. However, in times of war, all of a waranuux's members can be called to fight, and some groups do not even consider full membership attained until one has fought beside them. Waranuux commonly skirmish with each other, fighting over petty grudes, though this ritualized combat is rarely deadly, though it can still occasionally boil over into more standard conflict."

#OLD BOQQARUT DESCRIPTION IN CASE I MISSED STUFF IN IT#game_concept_boqqarut_damotada_desc:0 "The Boqqarut was the first polity to unify Damota in recorded history, emerging from the tribalistic warlordism that engulfed [pre_boqqarut_damota|E] under the leadership of Eshwo. Eshwo, though considered the First Boqqar, did not in reality control all of Damota, instead concentrating his power around the great lakes and thinner jungles of the region, with much of the green depths left unexplored. During his reign, he would codify the Mogowai faith, placing it under his own direct authority in an attempt to maintain order across his new domain. When he died in 297 IS, the throne would pass to his son Letanya, beginning the [mesir_dynasty|E]. Under a few generations of competent administration, the state would begin to stretch outwards, colonizing the surrounding jungles, in addition to constructing grand edifices and impressive structures across Damota. Their dynasty would end in 497 IS, when the first [tetenik|E] would replace them with the [olani_dynasty|E]. Under the Olanis, Damota would reach what most would consider its peak, spreading across the entire jungle, and reaching an unprecedented level of prosperity for the region. However, the most important event during the reign of the Olanis was the formation of the [rayakuux_orders|E] in 572 IS, as a move to cement religious legitimacy. These organizations would quickly exceed their original purpose, beginning a decline in central authority that would prevail for the rest of the Boqqarut's history.\n\nWhen the Olani dynasty fell during the Second [tetenik|E], the [rayakuux_orders|E] would play a key role in the ascencion of the [belar_dynasty|E], and of the man who is commonly considered the last great Boqqar. Raloka's reign saw Damota rejuvenate from the decay that had begun to overtake it, and the construction of a grand roadway through the Boqqarut's territories, in addition to various grand, ambitious projects. After his death in 712 IS, his son would struggle to pay for these debts, and would watch as the newly-split [lodges|E] began to integrate themselves into every aspect of daily life. As they grew in power, they began to enter politics in force and large numbers, becoming a balance to the hereditary aristocracy that until now had held a monopoly on power. The Third, and final, [tetenik|E] would soon begin, seeing the [zalreb_dynasty|E] take power, under whom the Boqqarut's decline would continue. Though Kayoba's death in 861 IS, beginning the [etami_tetenik|E], would officially mark the end of the Boqqarut, the Boqqars had become largely powerless a generation before, leaving the corpse of Damota for the [lodges|E] and nobles to feud over."
