game_concept_war_in_heaven:0 "The War in Heaven"
game_concept_war_in_heaven_desc:0 "The War in Heaven was the brutal near-1000 years of conflict between the [wardenites|E] and [ritualists|E] from 296 IS with the rise of The First Warden to 1237 IS with the fall of the last independent [ritualist|E] ruler. While the war contained dozens of various sides of many different faiths that would rise and fall on behalf of one of the sides (or both or neither), the main conflict always surrounded the warlords of the [ritualist|E] and [wardenite|E] faiths.\n\nThe war was extremely bitter and brought widespread devastation to [sarradon|E]. While the continent had several high points during the midst of the conflict, it was always soon ended by a continuation of warfare. The use of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] by the competing Qurati and the Almadi [magi|E] Cabals led to seemingly the end of [sarradonian|E] prosperity, wiping out 80% of the [magi|E] population and millions otherwise.\n\nThe 'war' (which was actually dozens of smaller conflicts over the time period), began to end with the arrival of Agionist, [chevalien|E] and [aversarian|E] merchants and mercenaries from [greater_aversaria|E] in 1144 IS. The northerners initially opened up several trade posts and brought new life to a continent still recovering from the destruction of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E]. Initially, they simply bought more and more land, but then began greatly expanding their reach by outright taking land from the [sarradonians|E]. The war officially ended in 1237 IS with the Siege of Gromze, the last free castle of the [ritualist|E] faith in [sarradon|E]. While the following (and partially concurrent) [saints_war|E] is sometimes considered a continuation of the war, most [sarradonian|E] scholars see it as a separate and new conflict."

game_concept_the_decimation_of_sarradon_desc:0 "The name given to the devastation wrought by [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] in Sarradon in 802 IS as Qurati and the Almadi magi cabals unleashed heinous magics upon each other in an attempt to bring a violent conclusion to the war in heaven. While the Ritualists seem to have fared worse in the ensuing chaos, few among the Wardenites could count it a victory, as millions lay dead in a continent-wide conflagration that left both factions scarred and broken. The period of general chaos that followed is known simply as [the_downfall|E]"

game_concept_the_downfall:0 "The Downfall"
game_concept_the_downfall_desc:0 "The period of civilization-wide chaos and anarchy that followed [halakdun], the exact period this era covers are unclear, with different regions of Sarradon returning to stability at different times. Regardless of the exact time frame, the period saw societies across the southern continent radically reforged in the crucible of chaotic wars and starvation. Perhaps most notably, The death of the last Eastern Mamur al-Hudi and all of his family but his daughter [sanad|E] during [the_decimation|E] saw the Central [mamuramat|E] absorb its final rival for authority over the Wardenite Faith, fundamentally reshaping the religion of the First Warden in the era to come. For its part, the Central [mamuramat|E] faced its own crisis, as the Mamur Yusar - a magi of particularly noteworthy power who had survived the [halakdun|E] was driven mad by exposure sickness, and in the end was slain by his son [tathtali|E] after a costly civil war."

game_concept_worldeater:0 "Worldeater"
game_concept_the_worldeater_desc:0 "The Worldeater was a gigantic beast that was unearthed somewhere in southern [sarradon|E] sometime in 144. A giant worm-like [godtouched_creature|E], the Worldeater was capable of devouring entire cities, and destroyed much of [sarradon|E] over the course of ten years. Known for causing the 'Collapse', as [aversarian|E] scholars would later call the effective cultural reset of [sarradon|E] in the 2nd century, the Worldeater has remained infamous to this very day.\n\nIts bones can still be found in eastern [sarradon|E], from where Queen Rehdyia Uddayir slew the beast and was thereafter declared ruler of the continent in reward."

game_concept_sarradonians:0 "Sarradonians"
game_concept_sarradon_desc:0 "Sarradon is the name for the arid continent south of [greater_aversaria|E]. In the intense heat of the south, the coastlines maintain lush and cool climates thanks to seawind while only a scant few leagues outside their view the land rapidly turns to desert and rocky badlands. To the center of the continent, the land is turned to jungle thanks to eastern winds and several great rivers and lakes, which is home to the Adabyssian Empire.\n\nSarradon has been hotly fought over for thousands of years, the home of [war_in_heaven|E] which has consumed its politics for nearly 2000 years after the rise of [wardenism|E]. While extremely wealthy in minerals, commerce, and culture, multiple devastating events have led to large depopulation and famine across most of the continent. Most notably the use of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] in 802 IS that wiped out over 80% of the northern portion of the continent's Magi and most of the ruling class, leading to mass anarchy that soon after led to the Agionist and [aversarian|E] colonization of the region.\n\nTo the far south of the continent, tales tell of the Axoquilekko Empire which has been bitterly fighting the Adabyssians for hundreds of years. To the east, the Strait of Knives separates Sarradon from Aironoi and [the_continent|E], and tales speak of a time in which it was once directly connected by land. Through the strait, trade from the mysterious lands of the far east greatly enriched the west, though the twilight of Sarradon and the fall of [aversaria|E] has left it choked with pirates."

game_concept_malaak:0 "Malaak"
game_concept_malaak_desc:0 "Malaaks are avatars or incarnations of Ohrasik, and many righteous rulers have declared themselves Malaak over the years. Being a Malaak doesn't imply that one is Ohrasik, but rather that they have fully taken in and embody Ohrasik, and are thus an instrument of his will. Since Malaaks claim to be the most righteous, directly carrying out Ohrasiks will, they are thus often under intense scrutiny, and impiety can easily lead to their populace rebelling against them."

game_concept_sarataratin_militarism:0 "Sarataratin Militarism"
game_concept_sarataratin_militarism_desc:0 "While originally far more militaristic, the modern Saratarat faith split (the original incarnation now referred to as Saratadibe) after the devastating efects of [halakdun|E] which killed nearly half of all of the holy saratans upon which the faithful reside, along with much of the rest of [sarradon|E]. Between the death of so many saratans upon the backs of which most Saratarians live (and drowned with as they fell to the sea) and the deaths of thousands of Sarataratian faithful on those saratans that survived, the Sarataratian faithful entered a deep collective trauma.\n\nAfter the priestly caste of all saratan's met upon the great island of Shaqerbi (which they also maintained was formed upon the remains of the first saratan) in the Mathatto Prayer, it was agreed that further warring between the faithful would mean the death of the last saratans and their protectors. Since then, the Sarataratin have been known as peaceful and monastic traders, who reject all violence except only in the defense of the saratans."

game_concept_disuwai:0 "The Metropolis of Disuwai"
game_concept_disuwai_desc:0 "Founded by the Western [mamur|E] Maha in 542, Disuwai grew up as a trading port, its merchants filling their pockets with the wealth flowing from the trade with the Amsari and Kemsari in the far West. Even being sacked by the Ayyar wasn't enough to stop the city's growth. Nevertheless, the city would likely have gone down as a mere footnote were it not for the events which briefly saw it catapulted into the eye of the entire Wardenite world - The Kathsiti dissent. "
