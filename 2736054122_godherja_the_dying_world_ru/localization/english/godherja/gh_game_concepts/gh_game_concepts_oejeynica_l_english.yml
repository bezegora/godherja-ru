game_concept_sorrowing_of_oejeynica:0 "Sorrowing of Oejeynica"
game_concept_sorrowing_of_oejeynica_desc:0 "The Sorrowing of Oejeynica was an event that lasted between roughly 156 IS with the rise of the first [arch_lich|E] [vilas_venslau|E] and the destruction of the Enlightency of Vrawsyl and 171 with the fall of the last Oejeynican Kingdom and the beginning of [venslau|E]'s invasion south into [chevalie|E].\n\nThe Sorrowing of Oejeynica was the systematic destruction of all living things in the known world north of [chevalie|E], with [vilas_venslau|E] and his disciples converting to [lichdom|E] and committing the most widespread genocide in known history upon the northern lands, converting all living beings who did not escape into [chevalie|E] into undead to serve their purposes. The Sorrowing was partially aided by several large wars between the Oejeynicans occurring simultaneously, along with the multitude of wars between the invading [chevalien|E] tribes and the Oejeynicans themselves.\n\nThe Sorrowing established [chevalie|E] as the northern edge of the known world, and the reaction to it would both lead to the discovery and repression of [lichdom|E] and the beginning of [chevalien|E] [antimagic|E] tradition and the [antimagic_orders|E]. [chevalie|E]'s position between the living of the south and the Lichdoms of the north is one of the most commonly cited reasons for why Aversarian-Marcher relations have normally remained cordial, and were the source for the name '[marchers|E]' for Chevaliens, a term they carry with pride. Ever since the Sorrowing, the remains of Oejeynica have been referred to as the [lichdoms|E]."

#CHARACTERS

game_concept_vilas:0 "Vilas"
game_concept_venslau:0 "Venslau"
game_concept_vilas_venslau:0 "Vilas Venslau"
game_concept_vilas_venslau_desc:0 "[arch_lich|E] Vilas Venslau was once a minor government minister in the Enlightency of Vrawsyl. The most important thing of note about Venslau is how little any of the surviving historical record remarks upon him. An average (if sometimes remarked as odd or creepy) man, Vensalu came from a minor noble family of accomplished [magi|E] and served at his post with little distinction for some 15 years.\n\nThe record on Venslau changes suddenly in 154, however, when he performed a series of rituals to achieve what would later become known as [lichdom|E].\n\nVenslau would declare himself the first [arch_lich|E], and he and his acolytes, all of which would become nearly as infamous as he (most noticeably, [silas_stavro|E]) would destroy Vrawsyl and then the rest of Oejeynica within a matter of years in what would later become known the [sorrowing_of_oejeynica|E]. These first [liches|E] effectively wiped all life out of the ancient north, and then proceeded to launch an invasion south into [chevalie|E].\n\nVenslau reached further south than any [lich|E] in history, his army moving deep into Kalathipsomi after defeating most of the lords of [chevalie|E]. He would only be stopped after his mysterious betrayal by his apprentice [silas_stavro|E], though the reasons for this have been lost to time. While believed dead, Venslau's body was never recovered, and mothers tell their children stories of him returning to scare them into behaving to this day as far as [sarradon|E]."

game_concept_silas_stavro:0 "Silas Stavro"
game_concept_silas_stavro_desc:0 "[lich_king|E] Silas Stavro, who has also gone by such names as 'Miloch Milvanic', 'Thead Thaedaric', 'Gast Gaddiari', 'Blackheart', 'Shadow Speaker', 'the Slayer of the Sun and Moon', 'the Nightridden', 'Moonbiter', 'Soulcatcher' and for several days 'Edgeblade', is the third known [lich|E] in modern history and possibly the most famous.\n\nBorn somewhere in what was once the Enlightency of Vrawsyl in eastern Oejeynica to peasant farmers, Stavro was marked out from a young age for [magical|E] ability and in Vrawsylian tradition was quickly taken from his family for training as a [magi|E]. At some point during his training, likely around the time of his graduation from the academy at 16 and induction into one of Vrawsyl's Hetaeric Orders, he met and was apprenticed to [vilas_venslau|E].\n\n[vilas|E] would eventually become one of the leading government ministers of Vrawsyl, and then discover and turn to [lichdom|E], with Silas following in his footsteps. [vilas|E] along with Silas and his other acolytes would destroy all life in Oejeynica in the [sorrowing_of_oejeynica|E], and then invade south into [chevalie|E]. They would nearly reach what would become Etepezea before finally being stopped, only after Silas betrayed his master and slew him in an attempt to take power.\n\n700 years later, Silas would declare himself [arch_lich|E] and invade the Marches during the [anarchy_of_the_five_crowns|E] and the [red_river_war|E]. He would be defeated by [champion_of_chevalie|E] in the Palace of Gisredde, and his bones were thrown into the sea. Where he would stay dead, surely forever."

#GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS

game_concept_liches:0 "Liches"
game_concept_lich:0 "Lich"
game_concept_liches_desc:0 "A Lich is any [magi|E] that has achieved a state of [lichdom|E] through discovering the [four_forbidden_steps|E] and then performing the Thirteen Abyssal Steps. The soul of a powerful [magi|E] trapped within an unliving body, Liches are generally accepted to be the most poweful [magi|E] of the world. Having mastered Dead Magic in order to perform the Thirteen Steps, a lack of any understanding of right and wrong (or a lack of care) and unlimited time to study arcana means that each one is a caster of unbelievable power.\n\nThe first Lich was [vilas_venslau|E], who performed the [sorrowing_of_oejeynica|E] and established the [lichdoms|E] in the far north. He soon after embarked upon the first Black March, invading south in an attempt to extend his dominion upon all living beings (and presumably to turn them undead in order to better worship him.)\n\nLiches generally share several personality traits. The reason why is hotly debated, whether it is some aftershock from the ceremony to become a Lich or from only a certain type of person being willing to do so, or perhaps an endless life among the dead pushing a soul towards a certain kind of insanity. Regardless of the reasons, the list of shared traits can be found [shared_lich_personalities_here|E].\n\nDue to boredom, Liches often change their identities every few hundred years, and generally take what they see as 'beautiful' and 'powerful' names through alliteration."

#LOCATIONS

game_concept_lichdoms:0 "Lichdoms"
game_concept_lichdoms_desc:0 "The Lichdoms are the remains of what was once a series of dozens of advanced kingdoms, empires and magocracies under the Oejeynican culture. The Lichdoms were formed during the [sorrowing_of_oejeynica|E] roughly during the same period as the establishment of the [aversarian|E] Aautokrata and the arrival of the [marchers|E] in [chevalie|E] when the first [arch_lich|E], [vilas_venslau|E], unveiled his powers as a [lich|E] and scoured nearly all living things from the region before invading south. To this day, the Lichdoms have remained devoid of all actual life besides the occasional carrion bird, only the undead and their masters moving about the ruined land.\n\nDue to centuries of Liches absorbing whatever life force can be found, battling one another with extremely powerful magic, and corrupting the land, what was once one of the most fertile areas of [aeras|E] will most likely never be able to properly sustain life again."

#MISC

game_concept_lichdom:0 "Lichdom"
game_concept_lichdom_desc:0 "Lichdom is a state of undeath in which a powerful [dead_magi|E] has, through an esoteric ritual known as the 'Thirteen Abyssal Steps', locked their soul within their body and then committed suicide. The result is life seemingly unending, the [magi|E] living on as a [lich|E], a skeletal sorcerer retaining the full knowledge and memories of their living self. Due to the nature of the ritual, nearly all Liches in history have been necromancers, and have continued to focus in on that art into their undeath.\n\nNine of the Fourteen Abyssal Steps are known, and Four forgotten (known as the [four_forbidden_steps|E]). It is unknown if knowledge of them is truly lost or if most [magi|E] purposefully destroy any knowledge of them in an attempt to deter attempts towards the art, as Lichdom is considered highly foul in most societies. The steps in order are found [thirteen_abyssal_steps_here|E]."

game_concept_arch_lich_desc:0 "An Arch Lich (alternatively, Lich King, Dark Lord or Black Emperor) is a term traditionally given to any [lich|E] who manages to 'unite' (batter until they reluctantly follow) the various [liches|E] and [necromancers|E] of the [lichdoms|E] under themselves, normally in order to invade [chevalie|E] to the south.\n\nThere have been many Arch Liches throughout history, most meeting their end after being betrayed by other [liches|E] mid-invasion of [chevalie|E] and the rest being slain by some Marcher hero or another. There is still never shortage of those willing to try, however, and more liches claim to be Arch Liches than [liches|E] who claim they will be one some day.\n\nThe two most famous Arch Liches in history were [vilas_venslau|E], the first [lich|E], and [silas_stavro|E], his apprentice and betrayer."

game_concept_thirteen_abyssal_steps:0 "Thirteen Abyssal Steps"
game_concept_thirteen_abyssal_steps_here:0 "Here"
game_concept_thirteen_abyssal_steps_desc:0 "1. All close family members, generally believed to be at least twice removed, must be killed by the caster's own hands. It is traditionally accepted that this is to eliminate familial bonds that could lead to the soul haunting the family instead of being contained within the body.\n2. The blood of these family members must be drained and contained within lead vases, the metal coming from mines along waylines below sea level.\n3. The most prized heirloom of the caster must be burned or grinded into a dust, and the dust must be evenly sprinkled inside the vases of blood.\n4. ???\n5. ???\n6. The Caster must approach one of the world's [towers|E] to the point of [exposure_sickness|E]. The caster must then vomit out blood until faint, and cast a spell to ensure that they remain stricken by blood loss for the remainder of the ritual.\n7. Ritual symbols must be carved upon several points of the caster's body, matching symbols must be carved into the remains of the caster's family.\n8. A ritual circle must be drawn by the caster's own blood, matching the carvings on their body.\n9. Eight innocents (normally children) must be sacrificed at once, at points among the circle. 10. The blood from each vase must be consumed, failure to finish each will result in death.\n11. ???\n12. ???\n13. The caster commits suicide by slitting their own throat at the center of the circle. They will rise anew in seven days."

game_concept_four_forbidden_steps:0 "Four Forbidden Steps"
game_concept_four_forbidden_steps_desc:0 "The Four Forbidden Steps are four parts of the Thirteen Abyssal Steps to achieve [lichdom|E]. It is unknown why exactly they are forbidden, or by whom. Many scholars believe that knowledge of them have simply been lost since the rise of the first reported [lich|E], [vilas_venslau|E], while others believe that knowledge of as many of the Steps as possible has been long repressed by the powers that be.\n\nDiscovering the Four Steps is generally agreed to be the first step towards achieving [lichdom|E], and speaking of them is generally considered extremely taboo if not outright forbidden in nearly all cultures and religions that know of [lichdom|E]."

game_concept_shared_lich_personalities_here:0 "Here"
game_concept_shared_lich_personalities:0 "Shared Lich Personalities"
game_concept_shared_lich_personalities_desc:0 "Almost all [liches|E] are:\n\n1. Narcissistic: [liches|E] generally see themselves as the strongest beings 'alive'. All other [liches|E] are merely poor imitations of themselves, and all living things should rightfully bow before them. This generally leads to almost all [liches|E] being locked in constant conflict with another, seeing the mere existence of another [lich|E] as an insult to their own power.\n2. Atheistic: [liches|E] see the concept of a higher power as another insult to their own power, seeing themselves as the most powerful beings in existence. Generally, any [lich|E] who believes in any form of divinity (that they do not possess) see the Gods as a challenger to be destroyed.\n3. Greedy: [liches|E] constantly desire more power, spending their time either researching new and forbidden arcana in order to further their abilities or invading the lands of the living or of other Liches in order to further build their powebase.\n4. Deceitful: [liches|E] have little sense of morality, and will gladly employ any method they see as necessary to achieve their goals. This has led to the vast majority of [arch_liches|E] in history being defeated by another [lich|E] betraying them the second they find opportune.\n\nOne mystery about [liches|E] is whether or not they are capable of truly dying. It is generally agreed that if the skull of a [lich|E] is destroyed they are dead, along with other methods of destroying the soul within the body. However, many have theorized that even if a skull is pulverized to dust, the [lich|E] is still trapped within this dust, just unable to interact with the world."
