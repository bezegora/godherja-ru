game_concept_odrstund_desc:0 "The Odrstund was a [gedeora|E] that struck [aversaria|E] in 1168 IS. The largest in generations, the Odrstund seemed to primarily target [aversarians|E] [magi|E].\n\nOvernight, the [magical|E] aristocracy of the Aautokrata had their worst traits radically heightened. The callous became sociopathic, the cruel became bloodthirsty, the spiteful turned to hateful. The results (besides several serial murders) were not immediate, but quickly became apparent within a decade. With the [magi|E] more destructive than ever, [aversaria|E] began witnessing a rapid escalation in the number and scales of civil wars and internal conflict, with ten times the number of nobility being assassinated in 1178 than the entire decade preceding the Odrstund.\n\nAeschraes, leader of the Oraispol Aautokrata in the [imperial_civil_war|E], was born on the Odrstund. Whether this led to his casting of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] is hotly debated."

game_concept_imperial_civil_war_desc:0 "The Imperial Civil War (or [aversarian|E] Civil War) was a conflict between Aautokratir Aeschraes of Oraispol and Aautokratia Axiaothea of Asiupoli that took place between 1186 and 1200. While one of thousands of civil wars in the Aversarianas Aautokrata over the years since its inception, the Imperial Civil War earned distinction for being the one that ended the [aversarian|E] Aautokrata and brought forth the [fog|E] with Aeschraes (one of the pretenders in the War) causing [frodbrokna|E].\n\nThe war began after the mysterious death of Aautokratir Anesimasios, and the accusation that his wife, Axiaothea, poisoned him. In the [blood_senate|E] following his death, Axiaothea destroyed the entire gathering and the assorted nobility with the few survivors quickly bending the knee to her. On her return to the cultural capital of Oraispol, however, a coup was launched by Legon Aeschraes and Legio XXI 'Aeschraes' (now 'Axiaothea'), who proclaimed her a false Aautokratia and declared himself the rightful ruler.\n\nThe proceeding war lasted almost twenty years, leaving most of the Empire wartorn as nobility constantly shifted sides or broke off to form their own factions. The war was most notable for the increasingly extreme power of [magic|E] brought on by the rapid research and development of previously unused or underdeveloped spells. Entire cities were wiped out in massive [magical|E] blasts, southern Opakhasia was turn into a burnt out wasteland, and the war ended with a spell so large it brought forth [frodbrokna|E]. While Axiaothea was killed in this spell, so was the Empire, and Aeschraes's own realm rapidly collapsed in the following years despite his 'victory'."

game_concept_the_vilnian_assault_desc:0 "The Vilnian Assault was a battle taking place after the [imperial_civil_war|E] in the city of Oraispol, late in 1229 IS between the forces of Aautokratir Aeschraes of the reigning 'Oraispol Aautokrata' and Legan Isacea and her Legio XXI 'Axiaothea'.\n\nAs Aeschraes struggled to maintain his failing grip on [aversarian|E]—Aironoi in complete rebellion and the rest of the Empire drifting to anarchy—Legio XXI struggled to survive in Opakhasia. Having formerly been Aeschraes' personal legion (then titled 'Aeschraes'), they were brutally hunted throughout much of [aversaria|E] by the Aautokratir's lieuenant [karthyn_delenel|E].\n\nIsacea resolved to end Aeschraes' rule, claiming the legion and [aversaria|E] both would not be safe until the 'wicked Aautokratir' had been either killed or imprisoned, and resolved for the Legion to gather what allies it could and assault the capital.\n\nTogether with a Noble Legion gifted by by Despexir Hexon of Dymetra, a force of former-legionary's turned mercenary, and forces belonging to criminal organizations in western Etepezea standing in opposition to the underground network controlled by [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E], Isacea commenced her assault.\n\nThe attack was named for the Vilnian Gate (after Aautokratir Vilnian) around which the attack began. Disguised as merchants entering the city to trade from the northern village of Ilthia, Isacea and an elite force of forty men snuck through the gate and killed its guards, opening it to her force. Some thousand men either entered the city through the gate or threw off disguises they had been wearing across the city, and soon fought their way through the city and towards the Imperial Palace at the crest of Aexionarax's Hill.\n\nAfter finally reaching the throne room with heavy losses, Isacea and her remaining force attempted to kill Aautokratir Aeschraes, who ordered [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] and [karthyn_delenel|E] to slay her after a short confrontation. The events thereafter are unclear, but the assault would end in falure. [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Iron-Spike')|E] and [Concept('karthyn_delenel','Delenel')|E], along with the rest of Aeschraes' top guards, [magi|E], and his inner circle were slain in the battle ([Concept('demetros_detheniax','Iron-Spike')|E] and [Concept('karthyn_delenel','Delenel')|E] in single combat with Isacea). However, Aeschraes managed to kill the wounded Legan, and Legio XXI and its allies were fought back and out of the city with heavy casualties.\n\nDespite Isacea's failure, the assault would nonetheless be partially successful. The Oraispol Aautokrata was killed in the assault, with Aeschraes' entire inner circle who held the tenuous construction together slain and the prestige of the Aautokratir ruined, order outside of Etepezea utterly collapsed. Without allies and his rule collapsing, the Governor of Etepezea (Lycus Xenepheron) performed a coup against Aeschraes and usurped control of Western Etepezea, ending the rule of the Aautokratir."

While the war technically began with [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Methiads')|E] guerilla war against [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] and would continue after [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Iron-Spikes')|E] death in the [vilnian_assault|E], the conflict is most well known for the arrival of Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' in 1247 IS.\n\nNicanoneus would work for both [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Methiad')|E] and [Concept('oulnir_gurdurbok','Gurdurbok')|E] during his entrance into the conflict. Most notably in his assault on the [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Methiad')|E] alligned fortress of Tarwek and the assassination of [Concept('oulnir_gurdurbok','Gurdurbok')|E] loyalist Eldradd 'Bane-Star' Pithicladd.\n\nNicanoneus was given soldiers by both sides to battle the incoming [Concept('sjalvolki_migrations','Sjalvolki')|E] where he'd become the first [aversarian|E] to defeat Cenware Witch-Breaker in the Battle of Bergkoga, but would be quickly sent north after failures to secure his victory. Nicanoneus blamed both sides for this, and turned on his erstwhile 'allies'.\n\nNicanoneus's men would ambush [Concept('oulnir_gurdurbok','Gurdurbok')|E] in his estates in Ariosniai and his men successfully managed to assassinate the barbarian leader in the battle. Soon after, he would march west to deal with [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Governor Dethlycan')|E], who sent assassins and her personal legion both to stop his advance. Both would fail, the assassins being caught by Nicanoneus's personal guard and her legion defecting to the invader, and [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Dethlycan')|E] would soon after be caught attempting to escape west into [chevalie|E] and be executed by Nicanoneus.\n\nWith the war over, Nicanoneus assumed control of the north, and the Black Mountain War would soon lead into the [ash_war|E]."

game_concept_ash_war:0 "Ash War"
game_concept_ash_war_desc:0 "The Ash War (or the Rohrian Annex) was a bitterly fought campaign in northeastern [chevalie|E] between 1248 IS to 1251 IS between the forces of the [chevalien|E] Duke of Faisitelbouren (Duke Rhaon II den va Sissaux) with his ally King Ansfrei den va Seignon and the Partic tribe of Calagonii against Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' and his Imperial remnant.\n\nAfter executing his opponent [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Governor Methiad Dethlycan')|E] at the end of the [black_mountain_war|E] for 'incompetence and betrayal', an attempt was soon after made on Nicanoneus's life by still loyal agents of the former governor. While it is not known if they were acting out of revenge or simply had not known their master had fallen, what is known is that the agents were largely paid for by money given by her ally Den va Sissaux. In desperate need of supplies to fight the [Concept('sjalvolki_migrations','Sjalvolki')|E], Nicanoneus used this as an excuse for a campaign west, hoping to explot the civil war in [chevalie|E] to gain supplies to fight his southern war.\n\nWhile the [aversarians|E] initially made great gains, the mysterious arrival of the Partic soon threw the situation into doubt. Partic [magi|E] wreaked great havoc on [aversarian|E] supply lines outside of the [chevalien|E] [antimagic|e] Field, and Calagonii tribesmen fighting alongside [marcher|E] knights soon drove the [aversarian|E] forces back east.\n\nThe lines eventually settled in eastern Muisle, where trenches and battlements were dug so that [aversarian|E] [magi|E] could throw fire onto the fields before them while obscuring themselves from [chevalien|E] griffon riders. This period of static warfare was reinforced by the creation of multiple siege castles by both sides.\n\nThe war ended in 1251 IS when the Marcher-Partic alliance commenced an all-out assault against Nicaoneus's forces near the [lichdoms|E], using the hostile terrain and somehow timing their assault alongside a raid by the [lich|E] Ilnar Illadir. Nicanoneus was maimed by a firebolt from a Partic [magi|E] and during his two week coma, his forces were routed back east into the Black Mountains.\n\nVictorious, there was debate amongst the [marchers|E] about a possible invasion to [Concept('marcher_aversarian_wars','reclaim their ancient fortresses')|E] in the mountains, but this was cut short by the reasonless betrayal by their Partic allies. The Partic [magi|E] slew the Duke of Faisitelbouren and soon after conquered most of the Rohrian plains, ending the war decisively, and in the east a surviving Nicanoneus would reorganize his men and realm into Epavarion - the Ebony League."

The culmination of more than a century of [aversarian|E] decline, the Turmoil would prove to be one of the most destructive civil wars to grip the empire since the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], and though it would later ultimately be overshadowed by the [imperial_civil_war|E], many of the political fault lines and key players that would play pivotal roles in the latter conflict first achieved prominence in this decade-long conflageration.\n\nDespite its name, the epoch undoubtedly saw more than sixteen individuals pretend to the title of Aautokratir, the oft-cited number mostly only referring to those that held Oraispol or Asiupol for some length of time and not including the various provincial warlords that never came close to controlling either. Many of these would-be rulers of [aversaria|E] would come to be regarded as some of the most tyrannical and incompetent that the empire had ever seen - the monstrous Aeolus 'Bileblood', the prophet-magi Kyrgos and his Cult of the Purest's Flame, and the ruthless Mountani sisters (along with their famed rivalry) being only some of the infamous despots to rise and fall in the period."

game_concept_demetros_detheniax:0 "Demetros Detheniax"
game_concept_demetros_detheniax_desc:0 "Demetros 'Iron-Spike' was a Northern Aversarian warlord who maintained control over much of Kalathipsomi in the early 1200s. The bastard son of the noblewoman Kena Detheniax and (if rumors are to believed) Vedegar Brethaniac, the semi-legendary master of many of the criminal organizations in Aversaria during the peak of the [imperial_civil_war|E]. Iron-Spike was born in relative squalor in the shadows of the [mayikprolollan|E] in Prose on 1202 IS.\n\nCunning and shrewd, Demetros managed to use intrigue, guile, and intimidation to take the majority of his mother's lands after her death in 1209 IS; either killing or removing her trueborn heirs in the decade after her death. Demetros soon ruled most of his family's lands and began to rapidly expand them through further subterfuge and campaigning for the next decade.\n\nDemetros is perhaps most known (or infamous) for swearing fealty to Aautokratir Aeschraes, using the backing of the 'Lord of the Ashes' to further extend his domain towards the Black Mountains and begin what many considered a legal criminal organization that held much sway throughout Etepezea. Soon, Demetros had become known as one of the right hand men to Aeschraes, and many lords remained under the Aautokratir's grip entirely for fear of the assassins known to be employed by the Iron-Spike and his myriad of criminal connections.\n\nDemetros was slain in 1229 IS by Legan Isacea of Legio XXI 'Axiaothea' during the [vilnian_assault|E], alongside his counterpart [karthyn_delenel|E] in a duel with Isacea. With Iron-Spike's death (with no accepted heir), order in Kalathipsomi rapidly collapsed into infighting between revolting slaves, military commanders, criminal organizations and local nobility, and would remain in such a state until the Sjalvolki [migrations|E] in the 1250s."

game_concept_karthyn_delenel:0 "Karthyn Delenel"
game_concept_karthyn_delenel_desc:0 "Legon Karthyn Delenel was a Malcoisiac warlord born in 1171 IS. Legon of Legio XIV 'Chain-Forgers', Delenel was known for his brutality and efficiency in command of his legion primarily in dealing with slave revolts throughout the [imperial_civil_war|E] and afterwards in service to Aautokratir Aeschraes.\n\nDelenel is perhaps most infamous for being considered the mentor to Gorassos 'Skull-Taker', the infamous 'attack hound' to Aeschraes who cut bloody swathes through Aversaria alongside Delenel in fear campaigns to horrify the population back into order under the rotting foundations of the Oraispol Aautokrata. Delenel was given commands of five legions for this assignment, as well as his personal noble legions from his families extensive estates in Opakhasia and Malcois, and is generally credited for Aeschraes being able to control the two regions for the later part of his reign. Known for skinning his enemies alive, Delenel would use his limited magical ability to prolong their lives and would often also castrate, de-tongue, de-hand, and then skin notable captives in front of their men or families while giving speeches in Aeschraes' name.\n\nDelenel would meet his end in 1229 IS at the hands Legan Isacea of Legio XXI 'Axiaothea' during the [vilnian_assault|E], alongside his compatriot [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] in a duel with Isacea. With Delenel's death, his legions immediately deserted Aeschraes' service, Opakhasia collapsed without his fear campaigns and Malcois was soon swept under the tides of the Iyrossi Rebellions.\n\nOften forgotten in popular accounts is that Delenel survived the [vilnian_assault|E] though was mortally wounded. Abandoned by his allies and men, he returned to his estates in Opakhasia. There, his pupil Gorassos entered under signs of friendship and then beheaded his master for his collection of skulls, then raped and killed Delenel's family, servants, and slaves. This is commonly cited as the moment that Gorassos broke what ties remained between himself and Aeschraes."

Initially an [aversarian|E] legionary, Gurdurbok would take the north after deserting with fellow clansmen from his Legion (Legio XVII 'Pathos'), and would control the north under the command of [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E].\n\nWhen [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Iron-Spike')|E] was killed in the [vilnian_assault|E], Gurdurbok formally cut ties with [aversaria|E] (in a very well written letter to Oraispol), and soon after began a war in the mountains with rebel [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Governor Methiad Dethlycan')|E] for control of the north. Gurdurbok was known for using freed slaves to do battle, and showed great cruelty to [aversarian|E] settlers who resisted him. Despite this, and propaganda written by his rival [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Methiad')|E] showing him as a true barbarian, Gurdurbok was known for his great interest in literature, foreign theology, and the arts, and would often impress visiting emissaries by extensively debating these topics with them.\n\nGurdurbok met his end in 1247 IS with the arrival of Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun', child of the governor of Katraddia. Entering the region with his refugee army, Nicanoneus was routed around the eastern mountains after his defeat by Cenware 'Witch-Breaker' in the Mountain Gate War.\n\nNicanoneus would be courted by both sides in the [black_mountain_war|E] and would use forces from both Gurdurbok and his rival to score a victory against the Witch-Breaker in the Battle of Bergkoga, but would soon after be forced back north. Followed hotly by the Sjalvolki, Nicanoneus would blame his 'allies' for the defeat and deemed both too much of a liability for his cause. He would surprise and kill Gurdurbok in an assault on his estates, and then execute [Concept('methiad_dethlycan','Governor Methiad')|E] and assume control of the north, ending the north's period of civil conflict."

An ardent Axiaotheist and oft titled '[aversarian|E] among [aversarians|E]' among her contemporaries for her imperious bearing and absolute refusal for compromise with those she considered of lesser blood, Methiad was born into her role and began a bitter campaign of rebellion against the warlord (and her co-governor) [Concept('demetros_detheniax','Demetros Iron-Spike')|E] and his patron Aautokratir Aeschraes.\n\nMethiad was a powerful [magi|E] in her own right, and controlled a cabal of [magi|e] called the Seven Watchers, often considered the strongest [magi|E] in the north alongside her allies in the [mayikprolollan|E]. Not only this, but Methiad received numerous arms and funding from the [marchers|E] of [chevalie|E], with whom she had made numerous deals for generous land and resource grants in the Black Mountains.

Both sides would fail to make substantial gains, especially with the rest of Kalathipsomi in open collapse, and Methiad's position was thrown into even greater doubt with the collapse of her allies in [chevalie|E] (with the disappearance of High King Gardfrei) and the [mayikprolollan|E] (with [Concept('sjalvolki_migrations','Cenware Witch-Breaker leading the sack of the academy')|E]).\n\nWhen Governor Legon Nicanoneus 'the Black Sun' arrived from the east alongside his refugee legions, Methiad and [Concept('oulnir_gurdurbok','Gurdurbok')|E] both attempted to [Concept('black_mountain_war','court the foreigner to their sides in the conflict')|E]. Using forces from both Methiad and [Concept('oulnir_gurdurbok','Gurdurbok')|E], Nicanoneus would score a victory against the Sjalvolki at the Battle of Bergkoga but quickly be routed north soon after. Blaming his 'allies', Nicanoneus soon after ambushed and killed [Concept('oulnir_gurdurbok','Gurdurbok')|E]. Methiad suspected she was his next target, and attempted to send assassins as well as her personal legion to kill her former pawn. The assassins failed however, and her legion quickly deserted to Nicanoneus. Surrounded and without allies, she attempted to flee to [chevalie|E], but would be captured and then executed for incompetence by Nicanoneus in 1247 IS. Her attempt to escape west, along with another attempted assassination against Nicanoneus by her followers soon after, would be used by the Black Sun as an excuse to invade west into Chevalie in the [ash_war|E] soon after."

Most notable of them was the main academy in the mountains, from which most others were administered. This is the academy most often referred to when people refer to 'the' Mayikprolollan.\n\nThe Mayikprolollan was technically independent of imperial control, though was loosely held as part of the Aautokrata. Students from any walk of life and even homeland were allowed within, though they would either have to pay a hefty amount for a seat or show enough talent in an entrance test. While in the Mayikprolollan, new students are apprenticed to a resident Magi who creates a curriculum with them based on a variety of classes, lectures, and labs.\n\nStudents may attend a Mayikrpolollan for up to ten years or until 26 years of age. Every year, tournaments are held to decide the most promising student in attendance—an extremely prestigious title—and which students are not worthy of holding a seat in the academy. Historically, the long attendance of students and connection with their mentors has been used by the Mayikprolollan to control numerous puppets in the world's nobility, and with the collapse of the Aautokrata, the Mayikprolollan's soon after declared independence."

game_concept_oraispol_desc:0 "For a time longer than memory has Oraispol stood, its streets winding between the ruins of civilizations lost to time.\n\nBut of all to call the city home, the most famous were the Aautokratirs of [aversaria|E]. For over a thousand years, Oraispol enjoyed a place of prominence, as the center of traditional [aversarian|E] power, balanced against the rising eastern Governorate of Aironoi. It was where the Agionist Saints faced trial, where the Aautokratir Anesimasios was murdered. And most recently, it was the center from which Aeschraes reigned during the [imperial_civil_war|E]. Despite the years of anarchy claiming the Aautokrata after [frodbrokna|E], the city still stands, as perhaps the last remnant of Aversaria's golden age."

game_concept_blood_senate_desc:0 "A 'Blood Senate' is both the name for the accepted succession system of the Aversarinas Aautokrata and also for the actual gathering of nobility to perform it.\n\nFirst began in 243 IS after Aautokratir Akalionixos declared that whichever one of his sons could prove themselves the strongest [magi|E] may succeed him, he was soon after murdered by his daughter Maklea in an impromptu duel, who was shortly after declared Aautokratia and spent the rest of her reign largely hunting down her brothers. This was its origin however, and a thousand years of formalization and correction to attempt to prevent massive civil wars nearly every generation have led to its modern iteration.\n\nIn the modern world, a Blood Senate is declared just after the time of mourning for the former Aautokratir. The high nobility of the realm choose an agreed upon location and each noble family puts forward one candidate to compete, though other members are allowed to volunteer as well (though this is taboo) and non-nobles are also allowed to join, though this is also taboo.\n\nDuring a Blood Senate, the assorted candidates compete in a bracketed tournament to find who is the most powerful [magi|E] via duels to the death, with no mercy allowed at risk of disqualification. The last man (or woman) standing wins.\n\nOnly one Blood Senate has been won without [magic|E], by the Aversarian mercenary Nothyx, who used [antimagic|E] skills learned from the [marchers|E] to put down his competitors with nothing besides his sword."

game_concept_dethlediaxian_law:0 "Dethediaxian Law"
game_concept_dethlediaxian_law_desc:0 "Dethediaxian Law refers to a series of over 200 laws and edicts created by Legan Aganiaxa Dethediax after the [aversarian|E] conquest of the Iyrossi in 114 IS. While Aautokratir Phanagorax is often credited with the conquest of the Iyrossi Valley, most scholars agree that the conquest would not have been possible without Dethediax's skill (especially when compared to the oft debated competence of the Aautokratir).\n\nDethediax was known for her sharp wit and great knowledge of the Iyrossi, born from having been the master of [aversarian|E] fortes in northern Opakhasia before the Mytidon Campaign. Dethediax was appointed military governor of the valley after the conquests—often claimed to be the first governor of Malcois despite it not being an official Imperial province until 288 IS—and managed to create a code of laws and regulations that ensured the valley faced no major rebellion after her own death.\n\nWhile contemporaries accused Dethediax of Iyrossi sympathy, especially due to several portions of the law directly challenging the severity of [aversarian|E] rule and circumventing many Imperial laws, it nonetheless managed to fuse old Iyrossi codes with [aversarian|E] law to create a lasting peace between the two groups. Most notably, it used the Iyrossi rules of 'Blood Service' to create a palatable reasoning for the subjugation, and ensured that most Iyrossi would live as 'Autonomouse Slaves' in independent communes named 'Iyroikons' which gave them far greater autonomy than most [aversarian|E] slaves.\n\nWhile the Laws would be changed, rescinded, or reinforced multiple times during history (especially with the Theyssian Reforms in 766 IS), they nonetheless remained largely in place until the Iyrossi Rebellions in the 1200s."

game_concept_aversarinas_aagiokratia_desc:0 "The Aversarinas Aagiokratia (or Imperial Humanity in Aversarian) is the official state religion of the [aversinas_aautokrata|E] (similarly, Imperium of Humanity) and the historically largest religion in [greater_aversaria|E]. The religion itself is highly decentralized, with Aversarinas free to choose one of many local or foreign monastic orders and sanctioned cults to dictate their practice and interpretation of [aversarian|E] scripture. What is agreed upon by all schools, however, is that Aversarians are the true representations of humanity. The Purest arrived on [aeras|E] at some point in the past and either were joined by or then created the [aelfir_first_men|E]. The Purest was the first [magi|E] and most powerful one in history, and gave the gift (assuming they did not already possess it) of magic to the [aelfir_first_men|E] in return for their fealty, allegedly becoming the first Aautokratir.\n\nThe looseness of [aversarian|E] and the cynicism [aversarians|E] have began to possess in the latter centuries of the Aautokrata have led to the religion often being used to control the many conquered peoples of [aversaria|E]. Generally, when the [aversarians|E] do not outright wipe out or the peoples or cultures of a region, they will twist their religion to fit into the Aagiokratia in some form (normally conveniently brushing over the idolization of [aversarians|E] and enforce it as the proper and only legal sect of the faith. Cultural assimilation then begins, with portions of the population being declared [aversarians|E] and resettled elsewhere and unruly elements being stomped out, until finally the people's are all considered [aversarian|E] in nature if not in blood and are fully brought in as citizens of the Aautokrata, with their cultural cult either disbanded or brought even further in line with mainstream belief and largely sidelined."
