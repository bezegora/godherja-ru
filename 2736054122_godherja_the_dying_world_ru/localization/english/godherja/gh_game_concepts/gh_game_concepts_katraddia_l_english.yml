game_concept_doradalem_desc:0 "The ancestral homeland of the Mondecny people, Doradalem was almost a perfect match for the Mondecny culture's traditional isolationism, cradled as it was between towering mountains and surrounded by a forest wall so dense that it is completely impassable at most points. These factors meant that the Mondecny were rarely seen by their neighbors, and the mysterious land beyond the forest wall was often feared as a mythical place of wonders and magic by those who lived outside it. Inside the wall, the Mondecny lived in scattered towns and hamlets, pursuing a rustic, even primitive lifestyle sustained by the almost unmatched fertility of the land upon which they dwelled. Their metallurgic skills never surpassed the knowledge to smelt copper, largely due to the lack of any significant internal warfare (The Dethedklan Kin-struggle being the one major exception) or invasion from the outside world at any point in Mondecny recorded history. To hear them tell it, in Doradalem their lifestyle had not changed a bit since the day the gods created Aeras - a claim which, astoundingly, might even have been true."

game_concept_cnevobarthane_desc:0 "The peculiar god of the Theugombrians, Cnevobarthane is a solar deity usually depicted as a young man crowned with a brilliant halo and wielding a golden spear. It is believed by his worshippers that he is periodically reincarnated among them as an infant. The reborn God is unrecognizable at first, only regaining his memories and deific potency at puberty. Though there have been a few pretenders to this title throughout history proving the rebirth as genuine requires demonstrating powers beyond the ken of all but the most exceptional of Magi. Nevertheless, a the Speakers supposedly claim a list of nearly sixty canonical reincarnations going back over ten thousand years.\n\nWhile it is unclear just how much of that historical record is true, it has been noted that at least two of the three most recent Cnevobarthanes do seem to coincide with some of the most ancient legends of the people of the Continental Interior. These sparse handfuls of fragmentary written sagas and mutated oral legends speak of the rise of a successive pair of incredibly powerful Magi who were worshipped as gods a little over a millennia and a half before the rise of Aversaria."
