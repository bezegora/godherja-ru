 game_concept_akualion_tutil_desc:0 "The Aukalion Tutil, or 'the Comet Chase', was a great migration of the Nakahanii people in the 7th century that would ultimately bring them to the Night Coast. The precise location of the Nakahanii home archipelago is not precisely known, beyond the fact that it is located somewhere in [aeras|E]' great far eastern ocean. Led by the sage-king Kaiatu 'the Navigator', the expedition had followed the Crimson Comet westward, and the tribulations and heroes that would arise during its course would come to form many of the most treasured legends of the modern Nakahanii.\n\nAfter a decade-long journey, the fleet woud arrive in the Night Coast in 625, but disaster would strike when Kaiatu would be murdered in a parlay with the natives of Thrimbyso. A succession crisis would ensue as the king's most trusted advisor, widow and adoptive son each proposed different courses of action and competed for rule. Ultimately, the quarrel would split the Nakahanii into their modern divisions."

 game_concept_otachedian_empire:0 "Otachedian Empire"
 game_concept_otachedian_empire_desc:0 "The Otachedian Empire was an early 4th century political entity created by the great Öltenic warrior, statesman, and theologian Otached, who formed the first unified Öltenic realm through the [iorne_horde|E] after his stalemate in the [khayar_seldnii_darn|E] and his wielding of the legendary [iorne_seld|E]. Upon bringing the clans south into Kashirya, Otached realized the need for a more permanent and organized realm rather than the nomadic Iorne Horde, and so he disbanded the Horde and proclaimed the Otachedian Empire. Otached is said to have forged the second crown in Öltenic history, the first belonging to the sky god Ölgon-ten. He created also a mask of pure gold made from the melted down necklaces of a hundred Varodaist priests with which he declared himself Khaager-Khatan, the Godlike Emperor and the son of Ölik, God of Man.\n\nIn the years following his conquest of Kashirya, Otached spent his time building an entirely new political system only partially based on those of the Kashiryans he conquered. While he did not live long enough to enjoy his conquests for more than a few years, dying just at the onset of a planned expedition into Aironoi, the political structure he crafted proved to be longer lasting. Nearly all of the succeeding realms in Kashirya built legal systems following what is often called Otachedian Law, and Otached's rejection of the Varodaist priestly castes and his encouragement of sectarian religions proved to be the end of Varodaism and the birth of its many offshoots. Otached is celebrated as a great religious reformer by many priests for over a thousand years for his open-mindedness, with many calling him the Chakkara-Khaitan, a rendering of his title in the Kashiryan languages. While this veneration of him may be disputed, he was indeed fascinated by Kashiryan technology, innovation, and philosophy, and his patronage of the scholarly caste is likely the origin point for the Vidvaookeyatran faith."
 game_concept_taryaad_saramsaasan:0 "Taryaad Saramsaasan"
 game_concept_taryaad_saramsaasan_desc:0 "The Taryaad Saramsaasan was a Kashiryan polity that existed between the 10th and 11th centuries. The last of Kashirya's great historical empires, it stretched across nearly the entire region and maintained what many would consider a sadly brief but otherwise prosperous golden-age.\n\nWhile Kashirya had not been united for nearly two hundred years before the Taryaad, the [sabar_lambay_raad|E] led to a near full third of the sub-continent being devastated and nearly uninhabited. Asojiva, who slew the undead ruler Holkkarak and ended the event, used their widespread popularity to establish a new empire in both the devastated regions and their personal lands and took upon themselves the dynastic name Taryaad.\n\nThe Taryaad dynasty would proceed to rule for four generations, Asojiva and subsequent emperors declaring themselves to be reincarnations of the ancient god Paerasjatan. This, along with various political conflicts with the Vidvaookeyatran scholarly class and the Taryaad's worry that the scholars could cause mass-destruction with their disregard for safety in their practices, led to constantly conflict with the scholars for most of the empire's rule.\n\nThe empire would end with the great-grandson of Asojiva, Chutagrat, who commissioned the Vidvaookeyatran 'Sansthakap' sect to write a dynastic biography to further establish his rule. The Sansthakap's instead discovered that Chutagrat's father may have secretly been adopted to the dynasty, and that Asojiva had possibly been born a bastard to a minor merchant family. This would cause the collapse of Chutagrat's legitimacy and the [vaarash|E]. It is a popularly held belief that the Vidvaookeyatrans had invented the knowledge in order to eliminate their rivals in the Taryaads, though if this is truth, it is the first that they have chosen not to disseminate."
 game_concept_iorne_horde:0 "Iorne Horde"
 game_concept_iorne_horde_desc:0 "The Iorne Horde (or Eonic Horde), was named for the legendary [iorne_seld|E], which was used by the Öltenic warlord Otached to unite the Öltenic clans after [khayar_seldnii_darn|E]. While not victorious in his wars, that destroyed the Kathuni state of Cheyyungjei and wiped out both the Öltenic and Kathuni armies, Otached yet proved to perhaps be the most shrewd propagandist and statesman in Öltenic history, and he managed to spin his survival as proof of his descendence from the god Ölik.\n\nAfter uniting the Kolrgii Steppes, Otached marched south, away from Kathun-Kai. Öltenic tales say he had grown bored after defeating Xaoi Yaung Zayang, the mightiest of Kathun-Kai's warriors, while Kathuni historians wrote that the wars devastated the steppes just as badly as Cheyyungjei, and that the clans could not survive another war of similar scale with Kathun-Kai's largely untouched eastern armies. The truth is unknown, having occurred before even the birth of [wardenism|E] in [sarradon|E], but both accounts are commonly accepted to hold some truth.\n\nOtached led the horde south and into Kashirya, smashing the struggling Varodaist kingdoms and conquering down to the modern Pirate Coast. The Horde was disbanded thereafter and was followed by the [otachedian_empire|E]. Despite its short decade of existence, it greatly affected world history. The closing of the [oltenic_kathuni_wars|E] and the Khayar Seldni Darn reshaped Kathun-Kai, while the conquest of Kashirya established its first true empire. The unification of the clans gave rise to all following Öltenic cultures and religions, while the [otachedian_empire|E] and its successors greatly shaped the history of Aironoi and the [aversarinas_aautokratia|E]."

 game_concept_chan_skorpokaipis_desc:0 "The Chan Skorpokaipis (or Four Apocalypses) was a series of disasterous events largely (but disputedly) caused by Vidvaookeyatran scholars between the 9th and the 11th centuries. The events would become the defining event in Kashiryan history, many considering them the beginning of a new era with all of previous history distinctly ending with their onset.\n\nFirst was the [sabar_lambay_raad|E] or the 'Longest Night', where Vidvaookeyatran scholars accidentally caused the sun to be eclipsed exclusively in Kashirya for nearly a full year.\n\nSecond was the [murtuy_ka_varha|E] when the Vidvaookeyatran scholar Navad Javhad widely disseminated dozens of exceptionally dangerous spells which would cause undead legions to rise across Kashirya and nearly consume the entire region.\n\nThird was the [vaarash|E], during which Vidvaookeyatran scholars discovered pecularities with the lineage of the rulers of the [taryaad_saramsaasan|E] and immediately spread them across Kashirya, leading to thirty years of brutal civil war and an end to Kashiryan unity.\n\nFinally was the [chojakaan_ka_ghatada|E], where Vidvaookeyatrans scholars attempting to discover how to remove rust from metal caused twelve cities across Kashirya to dissapear, and then nearly cast [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] in an attempt to reverse this.\n\nThe end of the Apocalypses would come in the 11th century in the [dharya_varha|E], a mass series of anti-intellectual uprisings that devastated Kashirya for nearly fifty years."
 game_concept_dharya_varha:0 "Dharya Varha"
 game_concept_dharya_varha_desc:0 "The Dharya Varha, or 'the Righteous Years' was a fifty year long series of mass anti-scholarly uprisings across Kashirya in the early 11th century with the intention of ending Vidvaookeyatran control of Kashirya. While the rebels forces (whom styled themselves Dharyam Lon, 'Righeous Ones') swelled to massive sizes, their blaming of the ruling noble classes of Kashirya for allowing the Vidvaookeyatran's free reign in study led to the nobility of most of the region joining with the scholars against the rebels.\n\nWith the nobility and the scholarly classes (who made up most of Kashirya's [magi|E]) united against the rebel armies, the rebellions of the Righteous Years rapidly turned to stalemate. The rebels were unable to fight the nobles and [magi|E] in open warfare, and instead opted to spreading throughout Kashirya and strking at Vidvaookeyatran scholars all across Kashirya.\n\nOver the course of the Righteous Years, the Righteous Ones would pillage hundreds of libraries, academies and laboratories as well as assassinate hundreds of notable Vidvaookeyatran scholars. Thanks to a series of mass-reprisals from the nobility, however, along with the Vidvaookeyatran Saravadhan ('Mindful') sect's ritual that protected all Vidvaookeyatran libraries from fire (and also caused hundreds to freeze to death inside of several), the Righteous Ones' numbers slowly waned. The survivors would retreat to rural communities and give up active rebellion, instead forming what would become the Askevaryaan religious sect.\n\nVidvaookeyatran scholars have estimated that over 7,000 years of collective knowledge were lost in the event, as well as profess that the Righteous Ones represented the fact that there would always be those who reject helpful knowledge. Despite controversy, it is often argued that while several apocalyptic events may or may not have been the fault of the scholars, the Righteous Ones also had them to thank for a rise in life expectancy and literacy rates thanks to their disseminated knowledge."

 game_concept_murtuy_ka_varha_desc:0 "The Murtuy ka Varha was the second and perhaps most devastating of the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] (Four Apocalypses) which nearly destroyed Kashirya between the 9th and 11th centuries.\n\nBeginning in the 9th century with the [discovery_of_the_adiyya_ka_pharvaarava|E] by the Vidvaookeyatran scholar Navad Javhad, who proceeded to widely distribute dozens of exceptionally dangeorus rituals and spells he had discovered despite the clear risks involved. Within a year of this, cultists would use the rituals to raise legions of spirits and other undead, which they immediately lost control of. During this, Javhad continued to distribute the works while also insisting that the apocalyptic events were not the fault of his work but the fault of those not ready for such great knowledge.\n\nThe war reached its apex with the rise of the [lich|E]-like Satayan Holkkarak who directed the armies of the dead against the rest of Kashirya and only ended with the [death_of_holkkarak_and_the_end_of_the_murtuy_ka_varha|E]."

Multiple Vidvaookeyatran sects desparately attempted to discover a solution as a series of mass-uprising of disgruntled commoners began against the faith. The Dorajporian scholars widely celebrated when they discovered a fragmented ritual they believed, if properly pieced back together and performed, would return the cities to Kashirya.\n\nThis ritual would be later coined [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E], and it is unknown if the ritual was actually the devastating spell or if the Vidvaookeyatrans had accidentally recreated the ritual in their attempts to repair the original. The spell immediately destroyed Dorajpor and turned nearly all of its inhabitants into pillars of flame. It was only prevented from spreading to the rest of the world by the mercenary Kaytha, who managed to battle her way into the burning academy and slew the [magi|E]-scholars desperately attempting to control the spell, ending the ritual. The twelve cities would never return, Dorajpor would remain abandoned, and the Vidvaookeyatrans would go on to maintain that the second spell would most likely have solved the crisis if Kaytha had not stopped them.\n\nChojakaan ka Ghatada proved to be the final straw for many across Kashirya, and this anger would bring forth the [dharya_varha|E]."
 game_concept_sabar_lambay_raad:0 "Sabar Lambay Raad"
 game_concept_sabar_lambay_raad_desc:0 "The Sabar Lambay Raad, or the 'Longest Night', was the first of the [chan_skorpokaipis|E]; four separate near-apocalypses widely agreed to be the fault of Vidvaookeyatran scholars.\n\nThe Longest Night began when scholars of the academy in Haryaadad attempted to experiment with a recently uncovered spell that was believed to grant the caster the ability to see in darkness. Instead, the ritual caused the academy to be torn from [aeras|E] and launched towards [aervalr|E], which promptly seemed to move and eclipse the sun. While all of Kashirya was bathed in perpetual night, anyone leaving the region found the sun rising as normal, somehow only Kashirya seeming to be eclipsed. Vidvaookeyatran attempts to solve the issue were fairly disastrous, leading to events such as the brief summoning of a second, miniature sun which turned the city of Pethykloo to ash, and another which caused hundreds of food stockpiles across Kashirya to immediately spoil. The perpetual twilight and the spoilage led to a massive famine that would wrack the region for several years.\n\nThe sun would not appear again for almost a year, when a cabal of [magi|E] from the Aristaykan and Daramarjaratan faiths along with the [aversarian|E] [magi|E] Mechyos Prothex managed to cast a spell to cancel the first. This cost all of them their lives, besides Mechyos and the Aristaykan [magi|E]-guru Vogib, who would become fast friends after recovery and proceed to explore the world togther. Vidvaookeyatran scholars claim that the spell merely advanced time slightly, and that the year-long localized eclipse wasn't magical but a natural yet unexpected cosmological event."
 game_concept_vaarash:0 "Vaarash"
 game_concept_vaarash_desc:0 "The Vaarash, or 'Collapse', was the third of the [chan_skorpokaipis|E]; four separate near-apocalypses widely agreed to be the fault of Vidvaookeyatran scholars.\n\nThe Collapse began when scholars of the Vidvaookeyatran 'Sansthakap' sect were comissioned to write the dynastic biography for Chutagrat, the reigning emperor of the [taryaad_saramsaasan|E]. During the course of their research in his extensive libraries, they discovered several pecularities with Chutagrat's lineage, as well as information on the early life of the dynasty's founder, Asojiva. The Sansthakaps immediately disseminated the knowledge as demanded by Vidvaookeyatran beliefs, which destroyed the legitimacy of Chutagrat's rule and immediately caused what would become a twenty year series of brutal civil war. The wars would only end with the death of the last Taryaad pretender and with it the end the concept of any form of a united Kashirya.\n\nVidvaookeyatrans would make contradictory reasonings for why they were not at fault, claiming both that the Sansthakap's were a rogue sect not following proper practices who possibly invented the knowledge, and also that the destruction of the dynasty was proof of its instability and that the information was merely an excuse used by greedy nobles. Alongside both arguments was the usual mantra that the knowledge was rightfully shared with the people and that it was others fault for using it poorly."
 game_concept_bayyuralar:0 "Bayyuralar"
 game_concept_bayyuralar_desc:0 "Bayyuralar, meaning Western Journey in Archaic Kolrgiian, was an invasion of Aironoi by the Baytor, the last Kagakhatan of the [otachedian_empire|E]\n\nThe ill-fated expedition began shortly after Baytor's victory in the War of the Five Brothers, where he slew two of his brothers, exiled one, and turned his elder brother, Mogha, into his bondsman. While the war was brief and left Kashirya mostly undamaged, it was the first collapse of Otachedian authority and inspired the first rebellions against its rule by the native Kashiryans. With Kashiryan scholars publishing anti-Baytor tracts at the behest of his aunt and his rivals in other Otachedian kingdoms, and even his own Öltenic vassals and clansmen questioning his right to rule, Baytor decided to invade Aironoi to both secure new lands and to establish himself as the true successor of Otached's legacy. He famously declared the expedition west would cement him as being greater than his deified grandfather, Otached, leading to four attempts on his life and riots across a dozen Kashiryan cities.\n\nDespite this, he carried out the invasion and fought great successes in eastern Aironoi. The largest movement of Öltenic soldiers and clans since his grandfather's invasion of Kashirya, the Otachedian armies were well-supplied, trained, and spirited for a new war. Morale was noted by contemporaries as being exceptional, as the generation that marched west believed they were given a chance to earn the glory of their grandfathers, something their own fathers were unable to achieve. These successes did not last long, and were likely gained as a result of the eastern realms being unprepared for any significant wars of this magnitude. When the horde marched west into the Astilik Empire, Baytor was thrown off his horse and drowned at the [battle_of_the_wall_of_astila|E], leading to the end of the Otachedian Empire and the establishment of multiple Öltenic warlord states in Aironoi."

Even among the Vidvaookeyatran scholarly class, who would normally be enthused at any discovered lore, the concept of releasing the findings became controversial. The lost knowledge contained a plethora of spells and rituals once completely unknown, that would allow one to summon the lost spirits of the past to communicate with or render aid, as well as let one commit to a rudimentary form of what in the west is referred to as [lichdom|E].\n\nDespite warnings, Javhad decided to begin copying the information en-masse for distribution. Many of the scrolls sent from his academy in Dorajpor found themselves in the hands of Daramarjaratan cultists, long ostracized from the mainstream of their faith for an obsession with necromancy. This proved to be apocalyptic, within a month of learning of the rituals, the cults of the southeast began rapidly performing the spells at a scale far beyond what both their bodies were capable of and what the rituals suggested. Whether because of intentional evil or accidental stupidity, the southeast of Kashirya was soon rapidly overwhelmed by legions of spirits and the undead, beginning the Murtuy ka Varha."

 game_concept_death_of_holkkarak_and_the_end_of_the_murtuy_ka_varha_desc:0 "The [murtuy_ka_varha|E] lasted some ten years, during which a near third of Kashirya was destroyed as war was fought against Holkkarak and the dead for some ten years, before the Asritaykan king Asojiva united the faltering realms of the living and led them against Kashirya in what would later be called 'Great Asojiva's War'.\n\nAsojiva united the remaining realms partially through war, but more prominently through diplomacy and intrigue. Most famously, Asojiva was a very prominent theologian, and fables would claim he united eleven warring kings of eleven different faiths through a three-day long theological debate over the true nature of sand and its relation with the creation of the universe. Regardless of the stories, Asojiva marched against Holkkarak with the largest army mustered since the days of the [otachedian_empire|E] along with a vast array of spells gathered by the Vidvaookeyatrans capable of destoying entire cities with apocalyptic blasts.\n\nThe event finally ended when the ruins of Caralovya were retaken by Asojiva, who slew Holkkarak and performed a ritual to banish the dead of the land back to the afterlife. As news of the victory spread, a furious mob gathered in Dorajpor and marched upon the academy there, where Navad Javhad had continued copying the rituals he discovered despite an inability to find anyone willing to distribute them. The mob would burn the academy to the ground, beat Javhad to death, and destroy the knowledge of the academy (along with thousands of unrelated books, scrolls, and tablets) and all of their copies. Local warlords soon took part as they reclaimed the east, declaring that all knowledge of the spells Javhad discovered were to be destroyed. Asojiva would then be crowned as the first ruler of the [taryaad_saramsaasan|E], which would last until the [vaarash|E]."
