game_concept_gh_agionists_the_saints_war:0 "The Saints War"
game_concept_gh_agionists_the_saints_war_desc:0 "The Saints War is the name for the various conflicts between the Agionist Holy Orders and the native [sarradonians|E] beginning in roughly 1144 IS.\n\nAgioninst, Marcher and [aversarian|E] merchants and preachers began landing in [sarradon|E] in 1144 IS not long after [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] tore apart the continent, and they were sold large swathes of land as trade possessions by desperate [sarradonian|E] warlords who saw them as a chance to rebuild trade and as a source of mercenaries for their depopulated armies. While there was some conflict with the foreigners, for the most part the initial settlement was peaceful, and largely welcomed.\n\nOvertime, however, the northerners began taking more land, eventually outright warring for lands that were not sold to them initially. Taking the brunt of the attack, the [ritualists|E] were the first to fall, the final independent [ritualist|E] stronghold falling in 1237 IS. Conflict against the [wardenites|E] began in earnest soon after. Now, the merchants and preachers found themselves bankrolled by the [aversarian|E] crown, the Agionists on the mainland being forcefully moved to [sarradon|E] and the Aautokrata extracting great wealth from the newly conquered territories.\n\nThe [wardenites|E] were pushed back, the Mamur being seen as weak and slow to respond by many. This was until the rise of Ḥārthah ibn Sarradon, the former chief general to the Mamur who began a one man crusade against the Agionists after the enslavement and murder of his wife by the Order of Saint Calysto's Key. While soon after captured and thrown into the ocean, he miraculously survived, gathering strength in the southeast which he soon turned into a grand counter offensive against the northerners, holding most of the eastern coast by 1254 IS."

game_concept_gh_agionists_judges_massacre:0 "Judges' Massacre"
game_concept_gh_agionists_judges_massacre_desc:0 "The Judges' Massacre was a four-day Agionist pogrom against leading [ritualist|E] intelligentsia, chiefly of the Jaduyada people, orchestrated by the Order of the Blind Watcher in 1207. The event had its origins in a satirical poem of unknown origin that began circulating early in the same year, its contents making a mockery of each Saintly Order, but also venting the accrued grievances of 70 years of [aversarian|E] rule. Dikansynite attempts to locate the author were thwarted repeatedly until, several months later, they claimed to have found the culprit.\n\nIn a curious show of seemingly extending a hand of cooperation to the locals, they invited leading, respected Sophocist judges to attend the trial as well, and help with the passing of justice. The native jurists, hoping to use the occasion to seek audience with their overlords, were shocked upon arrival to discover that they were all, in fact, the ones on trial. The ensuing bloodbath would begin on the balconies of the great Dikansynite hall of judgement, but would soon spread across Agionist-controlled [sarradon|E]. An entire generation of scholars, jurists and priests would perish in the purge, numerous [ritualist|E] temples would be demolished, and books beyond count consigned to the flame. Ironically, the very same Dikansynite judges responsible for the butchery would later be put on trial themselves and executed for 'numerous procedural errors' in the process.\n\nThe long-term ramifications of the event would be severe. Any hope of peaceful coexistence between the Agionists and locals would die, and going forward, the stability of their rule would gradually deteriorate until the outbreak of the [gh_agionists_faghira_jalil_revolt|E] a little over 10 years later."

game_concept_gh_agionists_faghira_jalil_revolt:0 "Faghira-Jalil Revolt"
game_concept_gh_agionists_faghira_jalil_revolt_desc:0 "The Faghira-Jalil revolt was a massive conflict that engulfed most of eastern [sarradon|E] in the 1220s. A result of decades of built-up native resentment against their Agionist overlords, the spark that would set the entire region aflame would come in 1222 in the provincial town of Tell-Jahara, when a group of Katharite knights beat a young child to death for a perceived slight in broad daylight. The act proved to be a breaking point for the locals, who proceeded to retaliate by burning down their local chapter of the order. A series of escalations by both sides then ensued, culminating in a massive wave of rebellion spreading across the land.\n\nThe war has received its name from the two primary leaders of the [sarradonian|E] forces - the [ritualist|E] priest Faghira in the west, and the [wardenite|E] preacher Jalil in the east. Lasting for around 6 years, it would see a seemingly never-ending series of brutalities committed by the Saintly Orders in an attempt to reassert their iron grip, most infamously culminating in the [gh_agionists_kahdavrakan_supper|E] of 1227. The rebellion would largely end in an unsatisfactory stalemate for both sides in 1228 - the Agionists narrowly managing to crush their opposition in the western theatre of the war, but losing de-facto control of Kekhenemhat in the east to the rebels. However, aftershocks would continue to affect the region for the rest of the decade, with most of the countryside having slid into anarchy in the past 6 years of bloodletting."

game_concept_gh_agionists_kahdavrakan_supper:0 "Kahdavrakan Supper"
game_concept_gh_agionists_kahdavrakan_supper_desc:0 "The Kahdavrakan Supper was a massacre conducted by the Order of Saint Sansia's Rose in 1227, in the waning years of the [gh_agionists_faghira_jalil_revolt|E], against the capital of the Hudi client kingdom of Kudamash.\n\nEntering the metropole under the flag of a truce, the Sansianite representatives would be invited to join the local ruler in a feast in honor of his nominal submission to the Order. The dinner would, instead, end with the Sansianites pulling daggers on their hosts and butchering the entire Hudi royal dynasty. After the city gates were opened from within, the bloodshed continued on the streets for hours, until the Agionists promised an end to the battle and honorable treatment for those still in hiding. The 'honorable treatment' would turn out to be gathering all the survivors on a nearby hill, and bloodletting them to death. The attrocity was not limited to the city itself, and in the coming months, what can only be described as an attempt by the Sansianites to utterly destroy the Hudi people wherever they found them ensued, causing a mass exodus to the lands of the Mamuramat south. In all, anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 perished in the mayhem.\n\nThe event, naturally, incited outrage across the continent, and the final crystallization of feelings among the locals that the threat the Saintly Orders posed to their very existence outweighted any petty feuds or regional squabbles that prevented their cooperation."
