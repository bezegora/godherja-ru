 stag_name:0 "Stag"
 stag_intro_desc:0 "After spending the better part of the day tracking it across the woodlands, my party and I have finally caught on to the stag. The noble beast is browsing among tall grass in a sunlit glade as we approach, hiding [GetPlayer.Custom('random_hunting_hiding_spot')], just out of its vision.\n\nI carefully [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ready_3'))], aware that even the most subtle of movements may be enough to alert my quarry. For a brief moment, the [GetPlayer.Custom('random_stag_gender')] raises its head from the grass and looks around, but does not notice anything afoul and continues on with its carefree demeanor."
 stag_encyclopedia_desc:0 "Stags are perhaps the most popular and widespread type of game to be hunted, both for sport and subsistence, on Aeras. Almost entirely safe and unlikely to retalialte in the extreme, it tends to prefer temperate to boreal environments, but can generally be found across the world."
 stag_victory_desc:0 "I [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ready_3'))] upon the majestic animal and take a deep breath. As if alerted by gentle sound of air flowing into my lungs, the stag lifts its head, making eye contact with me just as I deliver a [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_attack_grievious'))] into its neck. It still musters enough strength to run away, but I know that it will not be able to get far.\n\nAfter a relatively short walk, we reach the animal, half dead, lying on the ground. I quickly put the thing out of its misery, and prepare to skin it."

By the time it even thinks of slowing down, it will be so far away as to not even be worth pursuing."

 peacock_name:0 "Peacock"
 peacock_intro_desc:0 "The peacock is not particularly difficult to notice by virtue of its defining characteristic - its garish, colorful plumage. In fact, it positively stands out like a sore thumb amidst its surroundings. It appears not to have noticed me, and I ready my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))]."
 peacock_victory_desc:0 "The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] hits the bird right in its side, sending it flying frantically - half its own rapidly failing attempt at taking flight, half the force of the hit propelling it into motion. It quickly falls to the ground, however, thrashes for a few moments, and then expires.\n\nAs I approach to recover my kill, I marvel at the beauty of the bird, though now quite tainted by blood. Its tail feathers are an especial delight to look at, and I make sure to pluck a few to bring back home."
 peacock_escape_desc:0 "The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] misses by a wide bearth, and the bird is immediately alerted to my presence. Despite its clumsy appearance, it actually manages to run, rapidly gain momentum, and achieve a low flight that is fast enough for it to get out of my sight before I am able to [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ready_2'))].\n\nI attempt to follow in its vague direction, but quickly lose any track of it whatsoever. It is unlikely that it will remain anywhere in the vicinity, and I am faced with the reality that the hunt is a failure."
 peacock_encyclopedia_desc:0 "The common peacock is renowned for its beautiful feathers and somewhat ornery temperament. While this may make it a formidable opponent to gardeners and prospective menagerie owners across Aeras, to someone actually attempting to hunt and kill the bird it's a negligible threat."

 ibex_name:0 "Ibex"
 ibex_intro_desc:0 "The greatest challenge when hunting ibex is the rough terrain that they prefer to inhabit. The trek across the steep, treacherous mountains takes us days to get within sight of the beast, but our quarry is finally within range. I carefully position myself behind a boulder and [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ready_3'))], the grazing animal oblivious to my presence."
 ibex_victory_desc:0 "The creature does not even have the time to notice me before the [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] flies straight through its eye. Bewildered, it uses the brief few moments it is still alive to try and make a doomed escape, but merely careens off a nearby ledge and falls onto hard rock several tens of feat below. Though it will take us some time to climb down to its carcass, I am at ease knowing that the hunt was a success"
 ibex_defeat_injury_desc:0 "The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] misses narrowly, and skitters across the gravel, the creature now alerted to my presence. Quickly taking cover behind the nearby boulder, I hope to avoid the full brunt of its charge, but the ibex turns the corner with surprising agility and knocks me back, my head hitting something hard on the ground.\n\nI awake around an hour later, my companions rousing me. Our quarry was content to merely knock me out and then continue on with its business, and tracking it again in my current state will be impossible."
 ibex_defeat_death_desc:0 "The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] misses narrowly, and skitters across the gravel, the creature now alerted to my presence. Bad goes to worse when I foolishly attempt to unsheathe my sword and slay the ibex as it runs straight at me, but it proves far too quick, and rams me with the full might of its charge.\n\nI fly off backwards, already nearly incapacitated by the force of the hit, and realize far too late that I've been thrown dangerously close to the edge of a nearby cliff and am about to lose my footing. I only have to suffer a brief few moments of sheer terror as I fall down the incredible height before striking the hard, harsh stone below."
 ibex_encyclopedia_desc:0 "A horned species of wild goat, the Ibex dwells in the high mountains and hills across Aeras. Not a particularly aggressive species, hunting an Ibex is only dangerous due to the harsh terrain and difficulty navigating the high rock faces that they inhabit."
 
 boar_name:0 "Boar"
 boar_intro_desc:0 "Finding the boar's den was a relatively simple affair; they are not graceful nor particularly stealthy creatures. As we approach the beast's canopy amidst the grass, I raise my hand to halt the hunting party. This is to be my kill, and my kill alone. I continue on alone, hoping that the wind does not carry my scent to the animal. I take another step forward, and the boar shoots out of the grass. Before it can rear its head to face me, I [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ready_3'))]."
 boar_victory_desc:0 "As I aim, the beast spots me, lets out an ear-piercing squeal, and charges straight at me. Luckily, the [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] strikes true, nearly incapacitating the boar mid-run. It trips and rolls over neatly at my feat and then clumsily attempts to stand back up, but it is to no avail. Quickly, I finish the creature off with my dagger.\n\nBoars are often underestimated, and many a novice hunter has met their end bleeding out in a field after being gored by one. Luckily, today, the only one bleeding out is the boar, and it will make for a fine feast once we return home."
 boar_defeat_injury_desc:0 "As I do so, the boar turns to face me. It lets out a squeal, and I panic at its sudden movement. I [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_attack_unaimed'))] the [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))], aiming for its eye, but I mistime the animal's frenetic charge; it whizzes past the boar as it slams into me. I fall to the ground, but the boar does not stop; it continues running, trampling my torso. I feel my ribs crack under its weight. I grasp desperately for my sword, but my arm goes limp. Before I lose consciousness, I see the hog retreat into the woods.\n\nI awaken in pain an hour later, the fight existing only as muddled flashes of memory. My party informs me that the beast got the better of me, but in its panic and frenzy chose to flee its den rather than finish me off. I suppose I should count myself lucky to be alive, but this hunt is a failure."
 boar_defeat_death_desc:0 "As I aim, the boar turns to face me. With a deafening squeal, it begins charging in my direction. I do not have time to [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_attack'))] my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))], and the creature gores me, slamming into my leg. I fall to the ground, frantically trying to push it off to no avail.  With a thrust of its head, I once again feel the piercing agony of its tusks. This time, they tear through my abdomen. The enraged hog stares at through its dark, yellow eyes; if it were capable of such a gesture, it would surely laugh at me. It retreats into the nearby woods, and I am left to contemplate my fate as I watch it run - [ROOT.GetFullNameNicknamed], murdered by a pig."
 boar_encyclopedia_desc:0 "A large a brutish type of pig, the term "boar" refers to both wild species and domestic animals who have gone feral. While not particularly crafty, boars are heavy and highly territorial. Many hunters who have underestimated the threat of these beasts have paid for their hubris with their lives."
 
 wolf_name:0 "Wolf"
 wolf_intro_desc:0 "With great effort and skill we have followed the trail of the wolf back to its den, a crevice between two great boulders easily overlooked amongst the tumble of a densely forested hillock. As is tradition for quarry such as this, it is expected that only I go forward from here.\n\nAs I step within a few yards of the narrow mouth of the den, a threatening growl announces the presence of my quarry, silently padding forward and bearing its teeth. Though it appears to sense that something is afoot, it seems to not have noticed me yet. At this close range I will only have one shot with my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] before the beast is upon me."
 wolf_encyclopedia_desc:0 "The common wolf is a predator present nearly everywhere in the world - from northern [sarradon|E] to the depths of the [continent|E]. It is hunted less for recreation and more due to the animal's tendency to pick off livestock and be a general nuisance to farmers.\n\nThough perhaps not formidable on its own, most wolf species live in packs, and when confronted in a group, they're both far more aggressive and dangerous."
 wolf_victory_desc:0 "I draw my breath and [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_attack_begin'))] of my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))].

With deft grace my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] takes the animal through the eye, immobilizing it. The mighty beast is quickly reduced to a whimpering, bloody mess on the ground.\n\nI approach and quickly cut its throat, ensuring its passage into the beyond is as quick as possible. My hunting party approaches from behind me and congratulate me on my success. A wolf is a worthy prize indeed."

I reach for my knife, and manage to fend off an attack aimed directly at my neck in the nick of time. My arm is left a half-mangled mess within moments, as I desperately try to deflect the wolf's nearly fatal attacks. Finally, I manage to stick the knife squarely in its side, and it seems to get the message - I am more trouble than worth. It tucks tail and runs, and I am merely thankful that I am still alive."

 werewolf_intro_desc:0 "[aervalr|E] shines down upon the clearing, a cloudless sky giving way to a pale green light. With the brightness, it is easy to see what is before me, seemingly only more grass. But I know better, for the beast I hunt is a cunning one, and a deadly one. And then I see it, the greenish glow illuminating a human-shaped creature, that seems increasingly wrong as one stares at it. It charges towards me from its distance, its teeth bared in a snarl, blood ringing its mouth. Its eyes shine across the distance, green pinpricks in sunken black pits. Feeling a chill run down my spine, I draw my sword, ready to bring this monster to its death as it barrels towards me."
 werewolf_victory_desc:0 "The beast spings towards me with a guttural growl, a noise which seems to embed fear within my very soul. But I harden my heart, and raise my silvered blade, the werewolf backing off after a few swings. I advance towards it, yelling and stabbing, until the creature changes tactics, running to the side in an attempt to catch me off-guard. \n\nI swing my sword sideways to catch the beast, and I hear its whimper of pain as it suffers a cut across the chest. With the wound weakening it, I need only move for the kill, and I make a furious charge towards it, attacking with my blade as it desperately parries with claws or dodges the swings, occaisonally suffering from glancing cuts. Soon, coated in blood, the werewolf's eyes begin to dim as its movement slows, and I manage a perfect swing into its arm, severing its right hand in a single blow. As it doubles over in pain, I raise my shining blade once more, and plunge it into the creature's shoulder. After one last, deafening howlte, the beast collapses to the ground."

There is no doubt that this is the lair of the bear we've been tracking, but the hardest part — actually felling the beast — is only yet to begin.\n\nMy companions look at me, obviously intending to give me the dubious honor of making the first move."

It tries to stand up on its hind legs and take a swing with its claws, but the wound it sustained from my spear throws it off balance and gives me just enough of an opening to lunge my sword into its abdomen.\n\nAnd just like that, it is over."

Villages oftentimes organize collective hunts to bring down one when it strays too close, for the amount of venison it yields is enough to fill larders for months, and hunters from across the Shattered Coast flock to try their luck with slaying the majestic beast.\n\nWhat many underestimate, however, is just how dangerous the giant stag is. Though strictly plant-eating and content to ignore creatures that pose no threat, they are known to viciously retaliate when provoked, and their lumbering size does not slow them down one bit compared to their mundane counterpart. Many a foolish hunter has met his end impaled by the creature's antlers, not expecting it to actually strike back after their shot fails to kill it.\n\nIn front of me, I watch the beast that my party has been tracking for days, and I ready my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))].

 dire_boar_intro_desc:0 "The dire boar is a savage beast, its size and power easily rivalling that of a particularly large bear. Its chief weakness lies in its wits - a regular boar, though a simple creature, still must make at least basic risk assessments due to its small size, but its giant cousin has completely eschewed any kind of even vaguely rational thought in favor of blindly trying to brutalize whatever annoyance it encounters.\n\nThis particular dire boar did not even try to be subtle about its movements.

I manage to duck out of the way in the nick of time, and hear a loud crack as the beast slams head first into a nearby tree.\n\nNow even more enraged, it wastes no time in charging at me again. I prepare my spear, but realize that waiting for my quarry to charge into it would be incredibly risky considering the creature's momentum. Instead, I hurl it straight into its face, and my throwing arm does not fail me, thankfully - the spear pierces it straight through the eye, and the beast momentarily stumbles, but bafflingly continues its charge in a half-blind, rage-induced stupor.

Even if it were to cease its assault, the amount of grievious wounds that I have sustained likely cannot be treated by even the most trained physician - not that there is one anywhere nearby anyway. There is no escape from this."

 giant_spider_intro_desc:0 "If it weren't for the scattered bones lying on the ground and cocoons hanging off the ceiling, the gigantic spiderweb covering the mouth of the cave where our quarry resides in would be nigh-invisible apart from the most subtle of glimmers of reflected light. Despite being as thick as a rope, the web's strange optical properties make it appear as transparent as clear glass unless looked at from a highly specific angle.\n\nThe spider itself is nowehere to be seen, but it is most certainly in the vicinity - these monsters are not ones to roam, and subsist purely on whatever unlucky creatures wander into their lair. Of course, I have no intentions of actually searching for the arachnid myself. Disturbing the web is certainly going to attract the attention of the thing, and I begin to plan a course of action."

 giant_spider_victory_desc:0 "I pick up a large rock lying nearby and slowly make my way towards the cave. I am able to hurl the stone into the web from a safe distance, and I await with anticipation and a keen eye for my quarry to make its presence known. Slowly, a large, foreboding shape emerges from the darkness and approaches what it thinks to be its newest catch, unaware that today is its own turn to be the unwitting prey.\n\nAs fast as I can, I lunge towards the spider, taking care not to overshoot and run into the web. My sword strikes true - I can hear a crunch as its outer carapace is shattered and my blade dives deep into the monster's abdomen, but my opponent remains otherwise silent, despite the common misconception that giant spiders screech when provoked. It takes a few more stabs into the confused beast for it to fall off the web, and I continue my onslaught as it writhes on the ground. After accidentally lopping off one of its legs, the giant limb disturbingly continues to thrash on the ground, and I realize that any continued movement by the spider itself is merely a post-mortem impulse at this point."
 giant_spider_defeat_injury_desc:0 "I pick up a large rock lying nearby and slowly make my way towards the web. As it is located rather deep within the cave, and the stone is far too heavy to throw from the entrance and reach its target, I make my way inside - but as soon as I do, I realize the enormity of the mistake I have made. I am stopped virtually dead in my tracks as I walk straight into another, previously unseen cobweb, however I retain enough composure not to try and break free frantically, allowing myself to keep the mobility of my sword hand.\n\nI am fully expecting what happens next, but this anticipation does not diminish the dread of the sight in the slightest - a spider larger than a bear emerges from the darkness, its multitude of uncanny eyes looking at me. As it moves in to deliver its venomous bite, I am able to fight back using my free sword hand, and the spider seems to grow frustrated as it is unable to strike. A lucky strike in the creature's abdomen seems to injure it enough to scare it off, and I am left with the intensely painful and slow task of cutting myself free from the web."

 cockatrice_name:0 "Cockatrice"
 cockatrice_intro_desc:0 "#I "The Cockatrice, known to some as a Eagle of Aervalr, to others the Granite Cockerel, and to others still the Alchemical Dragon is a God-Touched beast renowned for its venom, immense ugliness, and foul stench. Most notorious of all is its gaze, piercing and deadly. The cockatrice is known to have an intrinsic relationship with the cycles of Aervalr, and can work transformations of the dead matter of Aeras with but a glance. It is for this reason that Dead Magi use the beast as a heraldic icon. Care should be taken, for if the moon is waxing full the monstrosity is at its most potent. It has a particular fondness for transmuting bone to stone, which has the effect of instantly killing any unfortunate enough to be subjected to its gaze."#!\n - Ragambald Manswel's Godtouched Bestiarium\n\nSuch was the advice given by those magi and guides we consulted. Our anticipation grew as we approached the beast's lair. Signs of its presence were clear in the form of petrified trees and the bones of wildlife turned to stone, still adorned with rotted scraps of skin and fur. As we approach the hollow whence it has made its home, we are struck with an overbearing stench - not of death or rot, but more reminiscent of an alchemist's rubbish heap. The beast appears to have formed a nest of petrified trees, twisted and pulled over the top to form an enveloping canopy. My hunting party looks at me with clear terror in their eyes. Though we have taken every precaution and ensured the phase of Aervalr is favorable, this fight is still bound to be a terrible one."
 cockatrice_victory_desc:0 "We lurk outside the beast's nest for almost half a day, my hunters hanging back to give me the first strike as is proper in the eyes of Velos. As evening approaches the monstrosity emerges, having finished whatever foul task with which it had spent the afternoon occupied, emerges from its den, head bent to avoid the light of the setting sun. Blinded by its emergence into the sunlight, it proves easy prey for our trap. Its bulk pulls the trip rope we strung across the doorway taught, releasing a tumble of stones upon its head from above. I barely give the monstrosity time to let out a cry of rage before I am upon it with my spear, plunging downwards into its scaled lower body and pinning its right leg into the ground. With a deafening scream it pecks and tears wildly with its twisted beak, but glances off my hauberk. I can feel a strange tingling spread across my skin, and with a sinking feeling realize I must act quickly before the abomination works some strange transmutation upon me. Unsheathing my sword, I swing in a long arc whilst shielding my eyes with my free hand. I have only one chance to get this right... Velos, guide my hand!\n\nI feel the sword slam into something fleshy, yet hollow, only stopping for a second when it impacts a harder substance that I hope is spine. The Cockatrice's horrendous wailing is suddenly and satisfyingly silenced. Dropping my hand, I have time to see the massive head slam into the ground, with the body falling limp and sagging against the spear pinning it into the ground. After a moment of silence my hunters, watching from the underbrush break out into raucous cheers and rush forwards to congratulate me."
 cockatrice_defeat_injury_desc:0 "Ducking low, I carefully sneak into the nest of the beast, shielding my eyes roughly at the point where I assume its face would be, hoping it may afford me some protection. While we have timed our hunt to a point in Aervalr's cycle where its powers to petrify should be weakest, I still don't wish to take chances with meeting the fell beast's gaze.\n\nThe nest is a twisted passages of petrified trees, reminiscent of a logjam lifted from a great river by a giant hand and placed onto land. Somewhere deeper I can hear an insistent scraping of claw on stone. I have mere seconds to ponder the cockatrice's activities before the rythm halts - and the sound is replaced with purposeful footsteps coming my way. Inevitable, perhaps, that I would not be able to ambush the beast in its den.\n\nIn an instant it is upon me, and I swing desperately with my sword, catching its talons and turning them aside from my flesh. Too slow, I can feel it cut deep into my side and I let out an involuntary shout. I twist my parry into a counter-strike and feel it connect and sink into the beast's flesh. Now it is the monstrosity's turn to let out a horrid shriek. Half blinded by my own attempts to keep my gaze off my opponent, I am unable to avoid the mass of the monster slamming into me and throwing me back. My head cracks agains a rock and my vision swims. Am I dead? Is this the end?\n\nI lie there for several moments, points of light resolving before my eyes? The terribly eyes of the cockatrice? No, just evening sunlight filtering through the roof of the nest. The beast is gone, fled and likely never to return. My hunters are surprised to see me emerge, having assumed the beast devoured me messily and left to hunt. I am alive, but my vision still swims and the wound at my side bleeds awfully. Though I did not take the monster's head, I can at least say I faced it and won for it was not I that fled."
 cockatrice_defeat_death_desc:0 "The fight goes wrong almost immediately as I enter into the beast's lair. I had heard that cockatrice are little smarter than your common chicken, but the moment I hear movement above me I immediately realize that to have been poor advice. A common cock does not know to ambush a would-be predator, but as I turn to try and face my assailant I am forced to confront the fact that this monstrosity is quite capable of formulating such a devious strategy. It must have heard my party's approach, and was waiting just overhead of the narrow mouth leading into its lair, perched atop a beam of petrified oak. Its weight bears me down onto the ground and my nose fills with an acidic stench. Twisting against its weight, I feel its razor sharp talons cut deeply into my back. I manage to painfully lever my torso against a long and jagged rock to turn myself so I am now at least lying on my back, face to face with the cockatrice, my hands fumbling for my scabbard as I take in the sight of the horrific monstrosity before me. It is scales and feathers, and bright talons, an abomination against nature and the gods. Worse of all are its eyes, deep pits from which twin stars bloom, blazing with an unnatural blue light in defiance of the darkness of its lair.\n\nWhat was it that they said about a cockatrice's eyes?\n\nI feel waves of agony from deep within me, like my bones are on fire. My frantic scambling comes to a halt with a sudden jolt as my joints seize up, my sword only midway out of my scabbard. I have perhaps a second to reminisce on my mistakes before I am no more." 
 cockatrice_encyclopedia_desc:0 "Associated with Dead Magic and Magi, the Cockatrice is a foul tempered and deadly beast. Its eyes are believed to channel the energies of Aervalr into the magic of transmutation - namely bone to stone. Dying to a Cockatrice whose magics are empowered by a full moon is believed to be one of the most painful ways to die."

Of course, most haunts are not active during daytime, so we have some time to prepare for the encounter until the Sun sets."

Only in this form are we able to truly defeat and banish the spirit, but it also means that it is at its full strength and capable of harming us directly. Luckily, it does not put up much of a fight. Though it lunges at me and attempts to drain my life, a few slashes by my enchanted weapon — which it evidently did not expect — sunder its ethereal form into pieces, and it lets out a ghastly scream before its form vanishes forever."

The methods may be esoteric and the risk is great, but the promise of a millennia-old magical servant in one's custody is greatly alluring for many.\n\nI wander through a canyon where several djinn are reported to dwell, and I know I'm close when I feel something pulling in the pit of my stomach. I spot something moving in a shadowy crevice, but it seems to be that the shadow itself is alive! It is the djinn's form, barely visible in the low light, and it seems to be eyeing me apprehensively.\n\n"O mighty djinn," I call out, remembering what my books taught me, "I wish to bargain! Offer me your wisdom, and I will offer you my power and protection!"\n\nThe smoke continues to whirl for a second, as if pondering my decision, before darting forward with a shrieking howl.

But more and more of it passes into the prism, until at least the crevice is empty. I close my parched mouth and look at the prism in my hands, now warm to the touch swirling with the same inky smoke that was once in front of me.\n\nMy prize safely secure, I put the prism in my satchel and leave the way I came, my mind awash with thoughts of arcane knowledge and esoteric mysteries that the djinn will surely divulge."

Any hapless adventurer that dies within the range of the stone has their soul fused into the ever-growing Fortune Eater bound to the Duszkam, forming a defense mechanism that only grows in power with age.

While the mammoth may be a domineering creature, capable of skewering a man in an instant, they're quite easy to scare, and split from their herd, with the right tool; fire.\n\nUnder the cover of night, the mammoths take rest around a small watering hole, with a creek whose stream leads down a rocky fall. With our torches and spears in hand, we quickly set them ablaze and spring from the thin brush in a cacophony of adrenaline. The mammoths scatter before us, roaring and heaving as the torches glaze across their eyes. One in particular, a behemoth of a creature whose tusks seem larger than its own body, flees from the watering hole. You give chase, following alongside the shallow creek bed.  As we grow closer to the fall, I ready my spear to needle as deep into my quarry's deep hide, my fellows doing the same. I can only hope it will be enough."

They are thought to possess nearly the same level of intelligence, though this is difficult to confirm due to their hostility towards the rare human they encounter.\n\nNaturally reclusive, they have survived in the most isolated and remote pockets of the Etepezean highland, inhabiting secluded, cavernous lairs and only occasionally emerging to feast upon local wildlife, stray cattle, or perhaps even the unlucky peasant. They generally seem to avoid drawing attention to themselves, so finding the abode of one was a challenge indeed.\n\nHowever, I have succeeded in doing so, and in front of me lies the entrance to a large, expansive cavern that I know for a fact is the lair of a wyrm. This will not be an easy fight in the slightest, and there is an extremely high possibility that I will not emerge alive. More than a few have sought the glory of slaying this creature, but very few are known to have succeeded."

While I was imagining that it would be large, I was not expecting it to be **this** large - its gaping maw is big enough to fit a child. Rather than blindly charging, it seems to size me up, trying to determine whether I'm a threat or a mere hapless fool. Judging by its next action, it seems to have reached the conclusion that I'm the latter.\n\nI am fully expecting it to snap at me with a ferocious bite, but it instead nearly catches me completely off guard by trying to knock me off my feet with a sweep with its tail from below - an attack I manage to dodge only barely. It then launches a far more ferocious and open attack, but miscalculates and falls right upon my sword. After jolting back, it adopts a far more defensive posture, and I notice that it is attempting to position itself closer to the mouth of the cave, presumably so it can retreat.\n\nAfter a few more quick exchanges that ultimately lead nowhere, I deceive the wyrm into trying to take advantage of a false opening in my stance. As it rapidly slithers towards the exit past me, I lunge my sword into it, its motion almost pulling the blade from my hand. Now grievously hurt, it begins to writhe uncontrollably and abandons any kind of strategy in favor of madly trying to bite me, but I manage to pull my blade out just in time to run it through the serpent's eye, finishing it off.\n\nAs it expires, I sit next to its bleeding corpse, contemplating what I have just done. Slaying a wyrm is the stuff of fairy tales and drunken tavern braggarts, not something that actually happens with any degree of frequency whatsoever.

To have proven myself against such a noble and mighty foe, this fight is truly worthy of song!"
 tinessian_lion_defeat_injury_desc:0 "We circle one another, the beast letting out a snarl as if to intimidate me. My heart thunders in my chest, as suddenly I realize just how massive this animal is. Despite standing on all fours its head still stands just above mine even in a hunched position! \n\nNo, these are a cowards thoughts!\n\nHalf in desperation, half in a last ditch effort to keep myself from running, I break the stalemate and rush the beast, hefting my spear and preparing to ram it into the animal's right eye. But the Tinessian Lion seems to have anticipated this, and with speed belieing its immense size, nimbly pads to the left. My speartip goes wide, scoring a bloody - but ultimately superficial - furrow along its left flank. Whether it feels the pain or not the beast shows no sign, but my blood turns ice cold as I realize I'm now overextended with the great cat barely an arm's length away. It snarls and leaps, massive jaws closing around my arm and claws like workman's daggers savaging my body. \n\nI've never felt such pain, but all in a moment the lion lets out a pained roar as my men loose crossbows  into its flank. Though the blows cannot be fatal, the sudden reminder that it is outnumbered spurs the cat into flight, leaving me bloodied, maimed, but alive."

Letting the emotional momentum carry me on, I rush forward raising my axe with intent to bury it in the great lion's neck. The lion answers my charge in kind, bounding forward with a deafening roar. Adrenaline courses through my veins as my axe arcs down, slamming with a satisfying weight into the beast's upper shoulder. I almost have time to feel proud before the Tinessian lion's massive jaws close around my head and neck. A wet darkness consumes my world, and I have a vague feeling of numness spreading through my body. A second later it tosses me out and through the air, the world spinning like a top. My head slams into the ground, a sharp rock gashing deeply into my cheek and the copper taste of blood fills my mouth. I try to rise but... nothing? I cannot move my arms or my legs, nor my neck. Nor, I realize, can I breathe. As darkness begins to close around my vision I see the strangest thing - a few yards away lies a body with no head. Who is that? And why does the axe they're holding look so... familiar?"

They are perhaps most known for their glowing red eyes, which many people believe they can harness the apparent magical power within for many remedies. While most Magi agree that the dire lion is not magically powerful, the origin of its unnatural roar confounds most scholars. It is said that when angered, their shout of anger can tear trees from the ground and cause men to burst.\n\nMy party and I have prepared as best we could. We have completely clogged our ears with beeswax and covered with heavy cloth. We eschew our helmets as well, as hunters say the beast's roar rings around metal so terribly it has caused minds to shatter. Finally, we've established our hunting ground, and have arranged dozens of hidden snares to prevent the beast from pouncing.\n\nAlready I can hear the massive footsteps across the land. I can only pray we can move quickly enough to kill it before it breaks our trap…"

Me and my companions rush forward then, but the following roar echoes so loudly through even the wax that I am forced to my knees.\n\nI have heard nothing so awful, but the wax and binds thankfully mute it enough that I escape with nothing besides a splitting headache and shaking insides. I am the first back on both of my feet and charge forward. To my horror, the beast snaps the trap in half with an angered stomp, but I am upon it before it can do more. While it makes an angered swipe, I just barely duck under it, and jab my spear so deep into its eye that I lose half the shaft. The death roar is so loud that it throws me clean off of my feet, and it is twelve hours until I can hear the following celebration of a successful hunt."

 giant_sloth_name:0 "Opakhasian Bear"
 giant_sloth_intro_desc:0 ""The Opakhasian Bear is native to the province which gives the beast its name, dwelling both in the lush well-watered lowland forests and valleys and the hilly highlands. Fully grown it towers over even the dreaded cave bears of Gurdurbrok, and it believed by many to be one of the largest animals living on Aversarian soil. Despite its name, the Opakhasian Bear shares little in common with other types of bear, and it is an opinion held by some scholars to whom I have spoken that the name is more the product of its size and general appearance than any similarity in character or temperament. Most notably, the Opakhasian Bear does not share in its so called cousins' taste for meat. Indeed, it is hated and feared by the Opakhasian farmer because of its greed for the fleshy varieties of pitted fruits they grow, not its predation upon their livestock and children. Having observed one's skull, I have noted its teeth are flat and broad like those of a cow rather than of any predatory beast. Nonetheless, care should be taken, for it possesses claws as long as a man's forearm and prodigious strength." -Ragambald Manswell's Bestiarium \n\nThe Opakhasian Bear we hunt has left a trail even a child could follow, both by its massive spoor and the irate farmers whose orchards it has raided. The only difficulty has been the wide distance the beast has seemed willing to travel, taking us through a circuitous tour of rural Opakhasia. Now, after days of marching we finally have the beast cornered in its den, a yawning tunnel the massive animal has dug into the side of a ravine running alongside a squat hill. It's large enough for two men to stand side by side inside it with neither being forced to stoop - a testament to the animal's legendary size. The darkness yawns before me, beckoning me towards the final chapter of my hunt."
 giant_sloth_victory_desc:0 "Our first step is to lay a trap, setting a pile of fragrant fruits and flowers bought from a local farmer a dozen or so yards from the mouth of the beast's den, then withdraw to the underbrush to await the brute's arrival. As the cool mists of the morning give way to the hot afternoon sun, the already over-ripe pile fills the air with a cloyingly sweet scent. First to be drawn to the sticky mess are hundreds of flies and other insects, but we do not have too long to wait before a long furred snout emerges from the lair, sniffing greedily at the air. Moments later the beast follows, emerging carefully into the sunlight. It's a massive animal with shaggy fur and claws as long as my forearm. \n\nBlinded by its sudden emergence into the sun, the ensuing fight is barely worth being called that. Racing forward ahead of my men, my spear takes the great beast in its neck as it bends to start consuming the sugary mess of fruits. It lets out a surprisingly high pitched squeal before collapsing, splattering me with sticky juices as it impacts the syrupy pile. I stare in disbelief as one of the largest animals in Aversaria dies so simply at my feet, by my own hand."
 giant_sloth_defeat_injury_desc:0 "After a few minutes of whispered conversation my hunters and I settle on a plan of action. Farmers informed us that while usually docile and shy, the Opakhasian bear is quite territorial, and given to violent anger if it believes its home is being trespassed upon. We fashion clubs from tree branches scavenged from nearby oaks and begin to pound them upon our shields, creating a racket that must be audible for miles, and it doesn't take long for the bear to respond.\n\nIt slowly emerges from its den, lurking near the entrance for almost a minute as its eyes attempt to focus on the source of the noise. Two of my hunters continue their drumming as one begins loading and winding my crossbow for me - if the beast won't come to us then we'll shoot it until it gets over its cowardice.\n\nJust as the man begins to hand me my trusty weapon, I feel the ground suddenly tremble beneath our feet. Looking up I have just enough time to see a wall of muscle and fur bearing down on us as the beast preempts our attempt at a ranged solution. My party scatters in terror, but I am not so lucky. One of its massive arms sweeps to the left and impacts me dead on, sending me flying through the air.\n\nAn hour or two later what remains of my hunting party pulls me out of a tree covered in my own blood and sick. The bear has thankfully retreated to its den, but not before killing several good men. I may have been luckier than they, but can barely walk and am in no shape for a rematch."

The impact against the rock is of such force that my breastplate crack open with a loud pop - a sound almost drowned out with the crunch of many of the bones in my spine following suit. Laying on the ground, I find my limbs will not obey me. My... my breath will not obey me. I can do nothing but stare in horror at the horizon.

It makes for an easy track to follow, an odd experience after weeks upon weeks of chasing rumors of eviscerated shepherds. But now the beast has, all of a sudden, lain waste to the land around it with savage indiscrimination. We know not why the chimera has changed tactics like this, but some of my hunters whisper darkly that the monster having detected us, is now attempting to mock us.\n\nThe very thought makes my blood run cold. We risk ambush by one of Aeras' most horrifying predators if we proceed"
 chimera_victory_desc:0 "The chimera was, as it turns out, too clever by half. It attempted to lure us into a densely packed copse of woods, allowing itself to be seen by one of my scouts slinking in during the early morning. But there is one thing the monster failed to factor into its plan: it has not rained in weeks, and we have fire. Its clever woodland trap will turn into its own funeral pyre.\n\nMy hunters and I take up position ringing the copse, each with an arrow with its tip wrapped in tarred cloth. We sneak as close as we dare so as to not alert our target that something is amiss and carefully take aim. Half our hastily constructed flaming arrows extinguish in flight, but the dozen or so which find their mark quickly set the dry kindling in the underbrush ablaze. The fire spreads rapidly, and soon turns the forest into a towering inferno. Even from a distance of a few tens of yards I have to retreat as the heat becomes unbearable.\n\nIt is not long before we hear pained howls mixed with panicked bleating. Something massive attempts to break free from the wall of burning forest, but in its frenzy our prey appears to entangle itself in the densely packed brush. Eventually the thrashing ceases, and we are left alone with the noise of the flame and the occasional crash of a tree collapsing in the inferno. Poking through the ruined copse a few days later, it doesn't take long to find the charred remnants of the chimera beneath blackened and collapsed trunks. A fitting end for a beast that thought itself so clever as to hunt its own hunters."

 manticore_intro_desc:0 "We have trekked for leagues on end, following a dodgy dirt path deep into a long-deserted valley. The difficulty lies not in the tracking of a Manticore, but in slaying the beast. And for that reason, the hunting party accompanying me is a formidable force. But, as with any hunt, I must slay the beast alone; they are here to render aid should I need it. Hopefully it does not come to that. The tension mounts the further we roam into the valley, and eventually, we see it: the nest of the Manticore, perched at the crest of the furthermost hill. I draw my bow, ready my sword, and advance."

I cannot get an arrow off in time, so I draw my sword, bracing for its impact. The Manticore flies directly into me, impaling itself on my sword. It screeches in pain as we both fall to the ground, dragging each other into the mud. In an act of desperation, I draw my dagger, pushing it into the creature's heart.

They are also known to be masterful magi, but consumed of a jealous hatred of human wielders of the art, will kill them on sight." - Ragambald Manswel's Bestiarium \n\nThe hardest part of hunting the enigmatic Shahmaran is not following trail or spoor - the Sarradonian Manticore leaves behind barely enough of either. Instead, we have followed folk tales, legends, and the reports of various merchants. There are probably hundreds of villages in Sarradon which claim to have a Shahmaran living in the nearby hills, but most of these are either complete fabrications or frightened villagers misattributing sightings of more mundane godtouched beasts. Suffice to say, we've spent most of our hunt in various states of frustration.\n\nBut that all ends today.\n\nMy hunters actually saw the damn thing we've been shadowing returning to its home, the ruins of a brick citadel perched over a long-dried riverbed in the arid highlands. They also reported what appeared to be a few inhabited dwellings a fair distance from the Shahmaran's lair - likely a Ritualist cult who I'd expect would be willing to die for their aloof "god". If we proceed, we're certain to be walking into dangerous fight."

The Shahmaran has disciplined her unasked for worshippers well, evidenced by the charred and magically twisted skeletons we discover just a few yards inside that area. If the Ritualists spot us as we make the final approach, they do not give chase nor try to raise the alarm as we cross the threshold. \n\nWe enter the crumbling great hall, chased across the finely cut stone floor by the light of the rising sun. All manner of strange treasures adorn the chamber. Hills of discarded books and manuscripts tower between rows of enigmatic statues and rocks which veritably hum with power. I can already feel a slight wave of nausea that I guess must be the beginnings of mild exposure sickness. \n\nThe mistress of the citadel seems to have expected our approach, and is sitting imperiously in front of the hall's long-dead hearth. There is no preamble, no attempt at parlay or speech as happens in the tales. She simply begins to perform a series of arcane signs with her hands as my hunting party and I rush to take cover and close the distance before she can cast her first spell.\n\nThe fight was terrible, she slew most of the hunting party - and many of the dead are left without bodies for us to bury - but we have slain the Shahmaran, its lifeblood flowing fitfully around the blade of a great hunting spear lodged in her neck."

As we approach the lair of the griffon we made sure to spread out, keeping one another within our sight and warilt looking up to the skies in case of ambush. The last thing we want is for the beast to strike us unawares and shred us into pieces before we knew what happened. My heart beats faster and my face is set with grim determination, eyes darting from point to point. After what feels like an eternity we finally mount the summit, finding the nest of the beast, but seeing no trace of it.

No longer shall its life flow through its body and no longer shall it take life, be it human or not. What is left of it is now ours. Its flesh, its feathers, and everything else that has made it a fearsome beast, it all belongs now to us. The hunt has now come to a good end.

It brushed away the spears of those who rushed at it. And with its mighty beak, it tore at my men. My companions became too afraid to get any closer, and so they let loose arrows, but the beast spread its wings and rushed away from us, fleeing the earth upon which we hoped to fell the beast. Just as I was given aid to stand on my own two feet, I could only watch helplessly as the griffon flew away. The sky was beyond our reach. And whatever arrows and spears were let loose simply fell back to the ground. Our hunt seems to have been in vain."

My companions try and help, but they are driven back by its beak and wings. The beast continues to tear at me. The talons pierce me, slash at me. I scream. I struggle to get away but the beast holds me down, preventing me from any escape. And with a swift strike, its heavy beak crashes against my head, smashing my skull. In my last moments, a sharp burst of pain and then nothing."

 royal_falcon_intro_desc:0 "The royal falcon is a terrifying predator, and one of few mundane creatures powerful enough to remain inhabiting the abomination filled mountains of the Mayikprolollan. Its regal blue and white neck makes it easy to spot, but spotting one like I have is far from the end of the fight. Following it, in hopes of being protected, are several normal falcons, though those are not my target. If it suspects me to be a threat, it will dive down at terrifying speeds and rip me apart with its razor-sharp claws and beak, or so I've heard. So, as I ready my bow, I hope my shot lands true."
 royal_falcon_victory_desc:0 "I loose my arrow and watch as it flies toward my target. The falcon turns its head in the direction of the approaching shot, but its reaction comes too late. My arrow strikes the base of its wing, causing it to lurch and start to fall out of the sky. Its following falcons scatter, but the beast is not dead yet. While it is unable to remain airborne, it seems it can still control its descent and it pivots toward me, claws and savage beak at the ready. I pull out my sword and make ready to counter its attack. The claws of the falcon hit my sword just as I swing the blade in front of me. It desperately flaps its wings, but my weapon strikes true, sending it to the ground. With a resolute finality I plunge my sword into its chest, putting an end to the fight."

I reach to pull out my sword with my other hand, but before I can draw steel the beast has taken flight once more. I breathe a sigh of relief that I must have appeared to be more trouble than it was worth to the Royal Falcon. While I did not get out of this fight with a kill, I was able to retreat with my life."

I don't have time to run, nor barely time to blink as it descends like a thunderbolt from the clear blue sky. It goes for my face first, so I am blind as I reach for my sword, and I am unable to grip it before the falcon knocks me to the ground and starts ripping at the rest of me. I attempt to struggle away, but that simply widens the wounds which it had torn with its claws. As I feel my control of my body slip away, I know this is where my life ends."

Thus far I have little to show for my efforts, but hopefully that will soon change. A monotonous stampede of starkly striped zebras crests a small hill at the edge of the wetlands, fanning out across its expanse. A lone stallion, oblivious to my presence approaches my hiding place, gnawing tenaciously at the vegetation. Slowly, I raise my bow and nock an arrow, steadying my breathing as I aim down upon the hearty beast's chest."
 zebra_victory_desc:0 "The arrow strikes true, piercing into the zebra's chest, though it's not enough to take it down. The zebra rears its head, galloping off through the floodplain, leaving me no choice but to give chase. \n\n  I can feel the fire raging in my lungs as the bloodied backside of the zebra tries to escape me. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I bound through a shallow stream, dodging a startled zebra  I barely had time to notice, and spy my quarry trudging up a muddy hill not a 100 paces from me. I quickly pull an arrow and nockit, aiming down upon the zebra who seems  far more sluggish, most likely ailing from the first shot. Another arrow pierces its hide, piercing through its chest once again and taking the zebra to the ground. I hasten to where it has slumped, and pull my dagger to slit its throat."

Stumbling from exhaustion, I trip through a shallow stream and barely catch my footing, tumbling right into the backside of another zebra! I was so focused on my prey I hadn't even noticed the animal resting upon a patch of soft grass. Before I can react, the zebra before me raises its hind into the air and kicks, hooves impacting my head with a resounding thud. I fall backwards onto the ground, my head reeling as my attacker gallops away in panic. I am blinded as blood begins to pour into my eye from a deep gash of split skin on my scalp, and I can feel what seems to be a crack in my skull. It's hard for me to see at this point, but I hope I can still manage to find my way back to the others without making things worse."

The dry grass crunches harshly beneath my soft steps as the plump beast comes into view, munching upon a berrybush. I try to slow my step and hide my approach, but the brush beneath my boot proves more than enough to alert the hog to my presence. It quickly darts, rear first, into a small hole dug under one of the larger trees in the surrounding canopies, though I can still see its long tusks sticking out from the shadows, the beast huffing and heaving at me. Though it may have noticed me, I can still take the hog down if I'm smart."
 warthog_victory_desc:0 "I steady my breathing as I notch an arrow, aiming down upon the hog in its den.  I keep my feet light, moving slowly but ready to dive before the warthog can get a chance to gore me. I let loose the arrow, its tip cutting through the wind and hitting the hog in its lower neck. It squeals wildly before sprinting out of its den in a frenzied dash towards me with all it has. I quickly grab another arrow and begin to move backwards instead of forwards, aiming down upon the hog. A second arrow pierces its tough hide, though it only slows rather than tumble to the ground. I dash out of the way and it's unable to keep up with my quick turn, crashing into the topsoil and forcing the arrows deeper into its skin. I slowly walk towards it, preparing my blade as the beast struggles to climb up from the dirt, and stab through its heart. The warthog slumps, lifeless."

I grip the shaft of my spear tighter, my knuckles aching as if the wood will be crushed in my hand, and plant my back foot on its end to keep the warthog from goring me through. \n\n The single-minded warthog skewers itself on my spear in its frenzied charge, squealing in pain through its bullrush. The shaft of my spear bends and quickly breaks against its force. I had barely a moment to move before one of its tusks pierced through my leg, the momentum sending me spiraling to the ground. I grip my leg in pain and expect death to be soon on its way, but it does not come. The wounded warthog did not stop in its charge. It continued to run, sprinting through the thicket until I could no longer see it. Though I might lose my leg, I at least did not lose my life."

The stocky, spotted form of a hyena stalks out of the shadows, sniffing the air around us as it steps closer to the corpse, cackling. We ready our weapons some distance away and begin to creep forward through the grass and shrubbery, slowly, waiting for the moment to strike.

I stand motionless for no longer than a heartbeat, but long enough for the hyena to take it's chance, and pounce me onto the ground.\n\nThe hyena claws and scratches into me as I struggle against it, locking its jaw onto the spear shaft to keep it from devouring my face.

 crocodile_intro_desc:0 "We have taken a boat downriver into a warm saltmarsh that is said to be a breeding ground of the crocodile. Large bugs sting and buzz around my entire body as I skewer a large, filthy chunk of pork meat onto the largest fishing hook I could find, further binding the meat with rope to keep it from coming loose. We row our boat near shore to make the wrangling of the killer beast a less formidable task. It's hard to see into the murky river bed, the silt at its bottom kicked high towards the surface, but if crocodiles lurk beneath my feet, what better way to draw one's attention than "fresh" meat. I stretch my arms, ready to throw the bait into the river, keeping my spear nearby for when the beast surfaces. I look towards my companions to make sure they do the same. When I turn back to the water, I notice bright green eyes staring at me from the waters surface with ravenous intent. The water ripples as the beast moves, revealing a form nearly larger than our boat! This will be quite the challenge indeed. I throw the bait as far into the water as I can, and wait. I will need all my strength for this."

As we pull the crocodile close to our boat, it rolls in the water, wrapping the rope around itself, before deciding on a new target to eat; our boat. Suddenly the razor sharp teeth of this ancient monster cleave into the hull, its jaw nearly as long as the boat's beam. Without a moment to lose, I grab my spear and thrust into the crocodile's neck, the beast roaring in shock as it continues to thrash and slam into the boat's side. I hold my spear where it is in the beast as one of my companions does the same, piercing it just below me. It takes nearly an hour before the crocodile tires itself enough for us to drag it onto the shore without risking limb or life. The gray scales of the beast sag as its gargantuan form is laid low beneath me. I mercifully end the crocodile's life, and take several of its teeth before we painstakingly attempt to fit the corpse into our boat."

A wise woman told us the tale of a secluded mountain not far from here that is supposedly a Simurgh's home, though no one dare venture to check out of respect for the beast. There is said to be a spring where the bird raises the unwanted children of the region, parents leaving their deformed or dying newborns at the foothills of the mount in hopes of the Simurgh taking notice - and pity.

The burning monstrosity continues its frenzied onslaught, nearly getting the better of me several times, but all it has to show for in the end is several more arms missing.

Sure enough we spot them easily as we crest the hill. I am honestly shocked by their numbers, there must be hundreds - perhaps even over a thousand - of the animals. Most are lazily sleeping, but on the edges I spot a pair of larger members of the herd roaring and slamming into each other with bone-jarring impacts. We set up camp downwind and begin to prepare for the hunt.\n\nNaturally my party and guides urge me to take one of the larger specimens, which the locals helpfully identify as the males.

I am mere feet away from the bull when she lets off a loud whine, which quickly alerts the herd and my quarry. In desperation I dive forward, but the panicked twisting of my now alert prey causes the spear to merely gash a flesh wound into its protective blubber. The wounded animal flees rather than retaliate, and dashes into the surf with a speed that belies its bulk.\n\nI stand, shocked at this turn of events as the bull dives into the waves and quickly disappears from view. I only have a few seconds to contemplate this turn of events before the panicked shouting of my party brings my attention to an unexpected threat - a stampede of seals, near blinded by panic, now scoot themselves with surprising speed toward the waterline.

They have all the speed, strength, and ferocity of a wild horse, combined with great soaring wings that allow them to flee—or attack—in any direction they choose. Due to their difficulty to tame or breed in captivity, as well as the position of their wings making it difficult to ride them like normal horses, they are only best to be kept as curiosities or hunted for sport. And today, it is the latter.\n\nI scramble up the path with my pages, traversing the hills that pegasi like to call home. The steep and uneven terrain is an obstacle that the winged beasts can navigate with ease, but there is nothing in this world that is indomitable to man.\n\nAhead of us, grazing on some grass by the path, stands a beautiful white stallion, wings folded along his sides as he grazes on some grasses along the edge of the path. Perfect! I nock an arrow, draw my bow, and take aim..."

The beast has crash-landed in a field, trying vainly to climb to his feet as he continues to gush blood. By the time I approach him, his movements have grown weaker, and my hunting knife makes sure that he won't suffer any longer.\n\nWith the pegasus slain, I safely cut the wings—thankfully undamaged and unmarred by blood—at their joints, which my pages dutifully wrap up and put away.

 hippopotamus_intro_desc:0 "We have waited until dusk, some distance from a small lake where a school of hippopotami has lounged under the blistering heat. It didn't take long to track the beasts down, but it would have been foolish to face them in the water. They're quick swimmers and can easily crush a man in their jaws. As night draws closer, the beasts rise and lumber their way up the shore to graze on the brush, and it is in that moment when I'm struck by how monstrous they appear. I had heard stories of hippopotami cutting themselves on reeds to grow stronger, or relieve pain, but the thick layers of oily blood coating the hippopotami made clear the tales were true. The beasts wander farther through the wetlands, paying almost no mind to their surroundings as they feast. We use this as an opportunity to sneak towards a lone hippopotamus that had gone further from the water's edge than the others. If we can catch it by surprise, and aim for its mouth, we can take it down."

The hippopotamus raises its head and stomps its hooves into the mud as it notices its would-be assailants. I spare no time, readying my javelin and aiming upon the beast's massive mouth.\n\nThe hippopotamus roars ferociously to scare us off, but I do not falter. As soon as I see the pink of its gum, and ivory of its teeth, I let loose- my javelin sailing through the air and piercing deep into the hippo's gullet. I ready a second as my companion's throw theirs, most barely breaking the beast's hide. The hippopotamus stumbles and wails, before attempting to flee into the water. I charge the beast down and, before it can turn its body to thrash me into the ground, I thrust hard into its eye socket. The hippopotamus whimpers, thrashing as my spear point drives deeper into its skull. My companions pounce upon the beast, piercing as well, and it does not take long before its bloodied form collapses into the dirt."

From our vantage point atop a hill overlooking the surrounding flooded fields I can see a large herd of zebra, elephant, and other herbivores browsing further into the marsh, while a lone bull rests against a small tree some distance from the others. If we are too rash, the other elephants might take notice and decide to intervene, but the goal is to take the beast down with speed. This bull would last for hours if our shots were not accurate, provided it did not manage to skewer us all. I make ready a spool of rope weighted at one end, my companions doing the same, furtively moving towards the lumbering form of our prey. The closer we get, the larger its tusks seem to grow- long enough to carry our group if the elephant wished. Slowly, to not draw the beast's attention, we wrap part of the tree in rope and wrap more around two others near it, in hopes to trip the elephant once it attempts to flee. We ready torches, unlit, nearby in the tall grass to scare the beast once it has awoken, and grip the rough rope to pull the tree under the elephant's weight."

I charge forth from my hiding spot, spear and torch in hand- one of my companion's holding tight to a rope coil that's wrapped around one of the elephant's leg.\n\nI throw the torch before the elephant as it struggles to climb from the ground, the beast roars in terror as it stumbles to get away from it. Though on the ground, its tusks make it far from defenseless. I watch for a moment to strike when my companion thrusts with their torch, causing the elephant to rear its head backwards. I take the chance and thrust hard into its throat. The elephant roars and thrashes, tossing me to the ground once before I pierce its hide again, my companions soon following. It takes half a dozen thrusts of our spears before the beast finally slumps, lifeless, into the soil, and I unsheathe my blade to claim its magnificent tusks."

I grip my hilt tight, watching the lion for its next move as I circle its perimeter. Suddenly the beast lunges at me with ferocious intent, and I dodge out of the way of its extended claws. I'm still close enough to the lion that an extended arm could grab its muscular form, and in the split moment after its lunge I manage to wrap my free hand through its coarse and rough mane.

The truth of this is one of many unknowns about the beasts, almost every single facet of their existence yet another mystery that scholars and monster-hunters have tried to divine for centuries.\n\nThey say ancient villagers would leave children out for the wendigo's taking as sacrifice, the beasts for unknown reason desiring youths and even apparently understanding human speech. What they do with the children is likewise unknown, as every time hunters have tracked down their lair there has not been a single trace of the youths, not even bones, not even if the wendigo had taken them only minutes prior.\n\nReports also claim that they carry a possibly human level intelligence, and seem to possess a deep and horrible cruelty and hatred of mankind. Hubris has led to them 'ruling' many villages offering tribute, but their hunger always takes over their pride, and eventually they always take and feed until none remain to give them homage. While none even know if they are a mutant, a species of animal, or physical manifestations of spirits, some have theorized that they do not actually need to eat. Instead, it appears as if the beasts somehow feed off… fear itself. To be hunted is their pleasure, for they almost always turn the hunt back around and devour those who chase them. It also means that our preparations have been esoteric and increasingly intricate at the Magi, MAGINAME's, suggestion.\n\nMAGINAME has prepared us as well as MAGISHEHE could. Before us in the clearing is a bound and screaming child with the signs of sacrifice. MAGISHEHE tells us that the illusion is the best we can expect, and that the wendigo should be fooled that the bound goat is a young boy until it gets close enough for us to be ambushed. Worst still, I know that it is pitch darkness out of our tunnel. The beast only takes its tribute precisely at midnight, not a moment before or after.\n\n"Once we arrive," MAGINAME states, "You will need to act with haste. If the beast gets the chance to ambush us, then this hunt will be over. Strike fast the moment you see it, strike for its heart, and do not let it get away no matter what you do. If you're brave and fast, then we'll survive." As MAGISHEHE finishes, the light from their hands dims away and they stop quietly tunneling through the underground with their spells. MAGISHEHE is silent before telling us MAGISHEHE feels its presence..."
 wendigo_victory_desc:0 "MAGINAME quickly gets to work, as we only have seconds until the wendigo discovers our trap or escapes with the bait. MAGISHEHE throws down ritual salts in a circle, says an incantation more quickly than any other Magi I've heard before, and then slams MAGIHERHIS hands into the ground. A second later and my stomach lurches as the ground below us launches upward, the ground above thankfully giving way to allow us through.\n\nWe jump into the clearing with weapons ready, RANDOMCOLOR magic bleeding off of MAGINAME's hands as we launch outward, and there stands our wendigo.\n\nWe are lucky that the beast was just where we had hoped. It is standing just above the goat, having already ripped the poor beast in half upon realizing our ruse. We each launch from the surrounding ground and dive in before it can escape our circle. It is an abomination. Its head is nothing but a deer's skull, and rotting, peeling flesh on their neck gives way to a dark imitation of a human form. It's unnaturally long limbs distend in ways their bones should not allow, and it easily stands at twice our height.\n\nBut we are many, and MAGINAME carries with MAGIHERHIM a litany of spells carried just for this moment.#N\n\n"Disgusting creatures!"#! shouts an ancient voice I do not recognize, though it is one that immediately sets my stomach to roil.#N "Manflesh and bone, fit for nothing besides labor! For work! For pleasure! I will rend you, I will flay you, I will devour you all! You dare rise against us!? You dare make pretensions against your betters!? You dare steal OUR gifts!?"#!\n\nIt swipes out with a huge, clawed hand, and it tears one of my footmen in half with a single claw. I blink through the gore as I charge in after slamming my spear upwards and taking it in the chest. What answers me immediately is a sickening screech that echoes in a thousand voices, both animal and human, the rest of my companions falling in after me.\n\nThe wendigo attempts to launch itself outward, but MAGINAME's chanting crescendos just as they do, and vines whip out of the ground and pull them back down by its ankles.#W \n\n"I am the aautokratir!"#! it screams.#W "I will rule this realm or I shall rule ash! Let that bitch in Asiupoli burn with the rest! They'll all burn, all of them! You come to me speaking of mercy!? You try leveraging my own children against me!? No aautokratir may rule if they do not sacrifice! How can I ever claim to deserve the throne were I not willing to give it all!? I will give the realm itself to take its crown! Now draw the circle, Void Walker!"#!\n\nIts hands swing out again, and I only just miss a swing that sweeps over head with such force and fury that my clothes bellow out in the wind. It crushes two more of my men, and then the vines snap, and it launches itself outward.\n\nMidair in its jump, MAGINAME screams and runs forward, and a magnificent light blasts out from MAGIHISHER hands. MAGIHESHE stumbles back as their palms seem to burn from the energy, screaming in pain, but what appears to be a comet rockets out and slams into the wendigo's chest. It flies backward, screeching and screaming.#S \n\n"DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE,"#! a voice that is my own echoes.#P \n\n"WE NEED TO RUN!"#! it yells, mimicking one of my men to tempt us to scatter.#X \n\n"DADDY, IT'LL HURT ME!"#! screams the long-dead child of one of my men,#X "IF YOU KILL IT, IT SAYS IT WILL HURT ME. IT'S SPIRIT WILL HURT ME. DADDY PLEASE."#!\n\nEvery voice I can imagine ricochets across the valley. Every single one, and thousands yet that I could never have imagined. I struggle through the pain, both emotional and physical, and slam my spear downward and into its heart. The screech is so terrible that my head feels ready to split, and my men are soon piling down on it behind me, chopping it to bits as it throws several of my men across the clearing in its dying swipes.#W \n\n"I am Arthenax! Fear me! Worship me!"#! it screams out.#S \n\n"Torment! TORMENT! Eternal torment! My own guard!? My own slaves!? They desert for these rebels!? They shall know to fear Aerasod'yanax, they shall learn to fear their master! I will flay their souls and cause them hell for eternity! They shall never know peace!"#!\n\nI lift the spear for a last strike, barely ducking yet another swipe from the monster as it struggles to stand against the mutilation.#P \n\n"Please,"#! RELATIONNAME says to me,#P "Please, please, please don-"#!\n\nI slam the spear home and into its neck. The screech lasts a second before turning into desperate gurgling, and then it shrivels and curls up as its limbs snap and break to allow it to fold into a ball. Slowly it seems to burn and turn to ash, the body rotting away as if time was moving thousands of years a second, before nothing remains of it besides the deer skull that once served as its head.\n\nWe did it. We killed it. A wendigo dead. Even now, though, even now that it sits as nothing besides a disturbing skull, I can still hear it… I doubt I'll ever truly be able to forget this night."

We had launched out with the idea that we'd catch it looking down upon the goat where we could easily surround it. Instead, it hunches over under the gnarled branch of a tree, one hand above it gripping the wood and the other relaxed at its side. It is a horrible, twisted creature.

It's unnaturally long limbs distend in ways their bones should not allow, and it easily stands at twice our height.\n\nI let out a curse then, and immediately I am met with a sickening, horrifying laugh.

WE'RE GOING TO DIE."#!\n\nI don't believe we have ever been so afraid in our lives, but we persevere through what feels like hours of the baiting, taunting, and the endless laughter. It launches at us with a hundred screams, its huge limbs a flurry of claws ahead of me.\n\nIt rips one of my men nearly in half, and as I swing, it reaches down and throws the goat at me with full force. The screaming animal impacts me with the force of a horse, and I can feel broken ribs embed themselves into my organs as I slam against the ground.

MAGINAME is there, MAGIHISHER face covered in blood from a horrifying gash across MAGIHISHER face. Several of my companions huddle around as well, as the beast slaughters the rest in the clearing's center.\n\nMAGINAME says an incantation and then the ground swallows us, the twilight forest closing off above. I feint sometime then, MAGINAME guiding us as far away from here as they can manage. Even as I close my eyes, even as I lose consciousness, even as we travel well away and several spans underground, I can still hear that laughter. I don't think I'll ever be able to stop it from echoing through my mind."

I realize then that I don't know if it was one of my companions or if it was the beast, but then echoes the sound of bootsteps and screaming, and everyone is running. Sprinting. I break through the treeline and run as far as my legs can take me, trying to gain any distance I can from that horrifying place. No matter how far I run, how fast, how much I scream, the voices follow. Friends, family, enemies, my companions, MAGINAME.

All the voices laugh now, all of them cry, and I realize now that I never hunted this beast. It echoes back my voice then.#S\n\n"A wendigo,"#! I say,#S "I'll hunt a wendigo."#!\n\nIn my last seconds of life, I realize I had never hunted a wendigo, not from the moment I said those words, alone to myself in my study.

 cheetah_intro_desc:0 "Hunting a cheetah is no simple task. Not only is the cheetah an impressive hunter active at both night and day, but it is also prey to many beasts of the lands it calls home. Thus, the cheetah is not only extremely fast, but it is also cautious. It does not touch meat that it has not killed itself, and works on ambush after stalking its prey. Thus our preparations are haphazard. No trap can bait it with surety.\n\nWe have tracked lesser game for several days, waiting for the beast to strike, scattering the herd every other day to encourage some of them to break off and get lost on their own. It eventually pays off, for as we watch one of these animals wander across the plains looking for its herd, we spot a blur of black and orange launch from a bush and at the beast.\n\nOur time is now!"

It is too busy goring its kill for it to notice us before it is too late, and the trap closes. The beast yowls the moment it realizes what is happening, and bolts out at me to bite its way from the group!\n\nI throw my net at the beast and cheer as it strikes true; the cheetah tangling up in the chords and slamming into the ground with a panicked screech.

 cheetah_encyclopedia_desc:0 "Cheetahs are large, spotted feline creatures commonly found throughout Sarradon. They are known to be one of the fastest animals on Aeras, and can easily outrun all mounts over short distances.

Their main predators are other large carnivores, such as lions or hyenas."
 
 pyralis_name:0 "Archexis Pyralis"
 pyralis_intro_desc:0 "Pyralis are normally benign creatures, said to live and die within furnace flames across parts of Aeras. Only able to survive and breed in fires, the strange creatures measure their lifespan in hours and will quickly burn to ash when outside of one. Their eggs, however, can survive for decades with fire and are so small that they are nearly impossible for humans to see. They have little interest in humans, however, and they have long been valued as parts of exotic toys (Aversarian Magi famously would make jars holding undying fires filled with pyralis colonies as gifts for children) or as central parts of festivals where many Aversarians consider the releasing of thousands through a running wall of flame to be a cultural cornerstone.\n\nHowever, pyralis only grow so large that the human eye can barely make their shapes out. Archexir pyralis are the exception, however. When a Magi creates a magical flame in a pyralis furnace, the flames sometimes cause extremely odd mutations upon pyralis. The most common result is the archexir pyralis, a giant version of the insect the size of a horse and with the ability to breathe fire. Even worse, it is said the heat of its shell is so hot that pyralis can survive along its skin, and thousands will swarm any would-be attackers threatening their nest.\n\nThe beasts are relatively rare, avoid human contact, and alchemists treasure the medicinal and magical uses of their bodies. This means that finding them is actually difficult as local authorities hunt them from the wild before they can start a forest fire and as local villages collect great profits on their corpses. It took some dedicated searching but eventually, however, luck eventually made herself known to us. After spotting the drifting blue light in the distance and the flames slowly spreading over the forest, we were quick to rush in."
 pyralis_victory_desc:0 "Archexir pyralis almost go nowhere without starting a fire, and sighting one can be incredibly difficult before other hunters descend on the beast. The moment we saw a distant forest fire, we dove headfirst, despite most recommending against such actions. I am thankful when we see the blue glow in the distance, as I had become afraid that the beast had been in our head the entire time.\n\nThe most important thing to remember when fighting an archexir pyralis is that the beast might now be the size of a horse but still possess a primitive brain the size of a child's fist. It doesn't attack with grace or agility, it desperately buzzes around and discharges flames from overheating with no actual accuracy, and while its stinger is deadly, it hardly knows how to manipulate the thing. It only takes a few minutes of battle, but soon the beast zips straight into the ground and curls in on itself in death, the thousands of tiny red lights around it zipping out of existence in a magnificent and… sorrowing show of lights."

The archexir pyralis is nimble and fast but surprisingly slow to react, their small insect minds not scaling well to their size, and their 'breath of fire' is actually more akin to a random outburst of it. Once one knows their movements and methods, it's quite easy to avoid the random bursts that seem less like an attack and more the creature attempting to let off excess heat. Despite the ease, however, the hunt comes to a horrible end when an arrow flies from the woods and impacts my leg! Local townspeople seemed to have caught up to the fire and attacked the winner, and we can do little besides retreat while they take our prize."

While one or two of the arrows embed themselves in the creature's chitin, however, most of them harmlessly bounce off. I stand horrified as the beast, a strange blue cross of a dragonfly and a dragon, twists around in the air and charges us. The one thing they didn't mention in all the tales was how fast the bastards are, or the massive stingers at the end of their tails. It is on me before I can even complain, spearing me through the gut with its stinger and then blasting me with fire for good measure, along with the thousands of its smaller cousins that bombard me."

Most retreat upon spotting us, and we don't bother pursuing - game of such trifling size is not what we are here for.\n\nEventually, however, we encounter one specimen that absolutely dwarfs anything we had seen previously - slightly larger than a wolf, this particular crab does not even seem to take note of our presence. Resting half-submerged within the water, it is likely to fight back with ferocity when provoked, so it would be best if the first few hits managed to kill or incapacitate it."

The beast is left stunned and unable to mount a proper defense as I deliver a few more blows to finish it off, and I am left with a rather battered dire crab body as a reward for my efforts."

Finally, just as I manage to take out my sword, the beast manages to deliver a powerful pincer to my abdomen, but I quickly retaliate by lopping off its claw.

While many tales claim the beast grows two heads each time one is removed, this is not actually true. Instead, they are born with a various number of heads, normally three to twelve. The more heads a hydra has, the more dangerous it is, though hydra infighting thankfully means most devour themselves before growing old enough to threaten anyone. The heads also do actually grow back, but only after a few days of rest, and hydra can die from blood loss just like most other beasts.\n\nWe have slowly tracked this one to its lair after weeks of following its trail, made especially difficult because they are aquatic beasts that prefer to dwell in rivers and swampy areas. It is an ambush predator, and finding it in the first place has been half the hell. Now we know it waits in the marsh ahead of our small boat, we merely need to pick out the heads, stab a few, and bait the rest onto land. Of course, actually finding the heads is an issue, and if we don't pick out the right ones…\n\nI force myself not to think of such things as we approach. We merely must kill the beast before it retreats, or else it will recover within days."
 hydra_victory_desc:0 "Our small boat slowly approaches the center of the bog we know the beast to be in, the silhouettes of our companions visible just beyond the treeline where they silently wait for us to trick the beast onto dry land. Our eyes are sharp, and the rowers careful not to touch anything besides water, and to try their level best to prevent the boat from making any significant waves as we approach.\n\nI stand at the prow, holding my spear up as I wait to see the great peak of the beast's head. It'd never get close enough to land to be attacked from it, so this insanity is the only possible way to attract it to the attack… and then I see it! The scaly head, the murky form, the distant silhouettes of the other two! I breathe out my relief silently, as I hadn't wanted to admit that even I would have been nervous about fighting so many.\n\nI give a nod to one of my fellow hunters, only for one of them to give a whispered shout and point at three other unmoving forms that rest just above the water. So it isn't a three-headed hydra. All the pity for that makes this far more difficult. With another nod, my two men and I thrust our spears downward, and the moment they bite into the beast's brains, the rowers paddle us out like hell itself is behind them.\n\nThis isn't entirely inaccurate, as three massive screeching heads come snapping out at me from within the waves with all the anger of a furious trio of gods. They are biting and snarling after us, and we just barely fend them off with a few well-placed jabs before the boat drifts into the shallows and we all live from it before the beast gets in a lucky strike.\n\nThe next is the most difficult part of hunting a hydra, angering the beast enough to make it give chase, doing enough damage that we could secure a victory before it uses its more desperate attacks, and doing enough damage while also not scaring it too much so that it doesn't disappear down the river.\n\nSome men cheer as we run from the shoreline, the beast charging out of the water with a furious roar that tells me it is quite intent on avenging its other heads. The other men from the trees run out then, several arrows flying and impacting the beast on its less armored underbelly.\n\nThe hydra realizes its mistake immediately, but more men are running to the other side of the river now, and others move to cut off its escape. We rush forward then, most of us trying to reach its exposed stomach, but constantly being rebuffed by the heads. One of my men manages a lucky swipe with their axe which bites deep down into one of the head's, black ichor shooting out in a jet which coats the warrior. He stumbles away screaming, the blood burning through his skin and exposing bone.\n\nAs its final two heads roar in panic, the gaseous bladder underneath its stomach deflates and from its mouth comes out plumes of toxic gas. I rush forward as my companions stumble away, just barely avoiding the cloud and ducking under its distracted heads. Spear in hand, I rush forward as it reels back, and slam the head home, deep into its heart. The hydra screams in agony as it stumbles away, before finally collapsing on the riverfront, several of its heads splashing down as my men cheer."

Each tip slides between hard scales and jerks down into the soft insides. Me and the others laugh for a moment as the heads sink below the water.\n\nAnd then we scream as three more thrust upward with great jets of water, their reptilian maws screaming in anger as they thrust forward at us to avenge their comrades. I brace my spear to meet it but it nimbly dodges it and instead goes for our boat.\n\nI only have a second to react as the boat bursts below me, throwing me into the air where one of the head's catches my leg. In my panic I somehow grab my spear just above the head and thrust it down into one of its eyes, and the hydra lets out a roar and sends me flying. Despite the pain I am actually thankful, for while I am breaking bones on the impact, if the beast had bit down instead of screamed then it would have easily bisected me.\n\nMy men in the treeline drag me back as I moan in pain, and I can see the hydra diving back below the water and swimming off from danger. No doubt it will recover in a few days, and I would be loath to find myself anywhere near here when it does."

The entire boat rocks back, several of my hunters spilling off the side as I struggle to join them. I give a shout for the rowers to get us the hell out of the bog when the first head comes snapping forward with a reptilian growl. I barely duck under, only to realize the beast had performed a feint. One of its other heads slams into my side and I scream before falling into the disgusting water.\n\nI struggle to swim upwards and towards the shore, not interested in anything at this point besides survival, when a horrible appendage whips through the water and bites down on my legs. Water rushes into my mouth as I scream in pain, and then I'm up and out of the water, and soaring through the air.\n\nFor a moment the beast releases me, sailing in an arc towards the water, when another head snaps out and clamps down on both legs. I only have a moment to feel the pain before it slams me downward and into several of my men who have remained hiding in the treeline."

How exactly they originated is unknown, as are their true forms, with them instead preferring to take the shapes of humans or animals. Local superstition holds that certain engravings can ward them off, though this theory has little evidence behind it. One can always tell a Shetani from the creatures it seeks to imitate due to the spirit's inherent inperfections, which manifest as distortions in its assumed body. Examples include missing or twisted limbs, abnormal proportions, or strange patterns marked upon the skin or fur.\n\nAs we journeyed through the humid jungle, torches raised so as to ward off darkness, we noticed a strange trail. The pawmarks of a cat with a single twisted leg suddenly changed to those of a human, and then by uneven hoofmarks. Carefully, cautiously, we followed this trail, knowing that it might have left it deliberately so as to lead us on.\n\nWe have followed the markings over the course of several days, with the feeling of being watched causing all of us to shiver with fear. Occaisonally, I could see a distorted figure ahead of me in the distance, beyond the small circle of torchlight, but I am unsure if it is merely a figment of my imagination.

It grabs onto my spear from behind, and its thick arms reach around me, one seemingly attached to the body in reverse and with black markings running across it. I drop to the ground in an attempt to escape its grasp, losing my spear and drawing a dagger as it shifts into a lion with only its front paws. \n\nAs it falls down upon me, I raise my dagger, and manage to stab into its jaw.

I've followed the tracks of one through the forest to a large, old-growth whose limbs hang nearly to the soil. As I step closer, looking for signs of my prey, I hear a squeak and barely notice a flash of quills disappear into a small hole at the base of the tree, hidden between its roots.

A lone porcupine comes darting out of its flooding sanctuary and sprints past me, frantically searching for a way out of its demise. In a flash, I'm upon the creature, blocking its escape into a thicket of bushes, and I stab downwards into its back, barely avoiding stabbing my hand on its sharp quills.

One shot will not be enough to take it down, but we need to separate it from the rest of the herd to make sure they do not run us down before the kill.

I make sure my blade won't fall from my side and ready my net, slinging it across my arm. The coatl is said to be ferocious and strong enough to crush a man with its body.

The beast begins to flail and thrash against the ground, hissing and wailing as its one free wings beats water droplets frantically across the us and the cave walls.

Each of us sit quietly amongst the lower canopy, careful not to alert our ferocious prey to our presence in hopes to catch it by surprise, and in our trap. With bait bundled in my hands, I extend my arms above the forest floor where a net lay conspicously, its ends tied around the neighboring trees to pull the gorilla high into the air once it takes notice of our bait and comes towards us. I just have to make sure to not miss the trap, or worse, be seen."

 rock_giant_intro_desc:0 "A twisted apparition haunting the craggy trails of Opakhasia, the rock giant is a beast of both the physical and the spiritual realms. While it takes on the shape of a creature made out of boulders and other stones, its true controller is entombed within - a tortured spirit seeking vengeance against those who inhabit Aeras for what they have done to it. Often becoming a bedtime monster to prevent children from wandering into these dangerous mountain passes, the rock giant aggressively attacks anyone it can find, blinded by its own rage. Destroying such a creature is not just a benefit to the daring hunter but also a boon for those that still live in these wastelands. To kill it, however, is no simple task. Because of the spiritual nature of the rock giant, it cannot be killed simply by breaking the rocks on its body, for it will just obtain more from the stone-plentiful mountains where it lurks; instead, it is said that the soul within is connected to a valuable heirloom hidden inside its main body. In order for the spirit to be freed, this item must be destroyed.\n\nWandering through the desolate mountain paths, it was only a matter of time until we heard the distinct sound of rumbling and a low yet agonizing groan. With me, I have a specially crafted Salisian war-hammer - a sword or bow wouldn't be able to break the rocks - and I grip it tight. This fight will not be easy..."
 rock_giant_victory_desc:0 "Within moments, we spot the unmistakable figure of the rock giant, towering over its surroundings. It takes but a second for it to turn towards us, and as it does so, it bellows with a terrifying sound of what I can only describe as a mix between a pained moan and a violent screech. Immediately, it runs at us with an unexpectedly impressive speed. The hunt is on!\n\nAs much as the beast is fast, it is not nimble - I dart, perhaps rather stupidly, under its \"legs\" and whirl around behind it, the giant unable to react in time to intercept me. Catching up with the still-moving beast, I let out a mighty roar as I swing my hammer at its right leg. With a mighty boom, the Salisian war-hammer impacts into the wedge between two boulders making up the leg, sending the giant tumbling down to the ground! As the rest of my hunting group start chiseling away at the giant with their weapons as both a distraction and an aid, I ready the hammer again and aim it at its torso, slamming it down and shattering it into uncountable amounts of pieces!\n\nDespite the damage we've caused to it, however, the rock giant is not dead. I call out to one of my allies to duck as a stone narrowly misses his head out of nowhere, the creature reforming itself a distance away with more rocks. Hastily, I scavenge through the rubble for something that could be the heirloom of the rock giant. To my amazement, I find it - the [ITEM] that must have belonged to the soul when it once lived! I can't waste any more time - I thrust the hammer down into the [ITEM], making sure it is well and truly annihilated.\n\nInstantly, the rock giant wails one final time as the boulders which made up its new body tumble down into a pile of stone - and lay still. Breathing deeply, I grab a piece of the crushed heirloom, the only remaining evidence of this rock giant's existence, pocketing it."

Roc eggs are known for their remarkable taste, those who have had the pleasure to try one describing it as being unlike anything else on Aeras. Not only is it a delicacy, but the destruction of Roc eggs is often decreed by law in realms they inhabit to counter their threat to livestock and rural villages.  This Roc seems to be a juvenile, four to five horses in height - a challenge, but not one our men cannot overcome.\n\nThe Roc seems to be distracted by a nearby goat farm, giving us the perfect moment to strike. Cautiously, I approach, careful not to attract its attention. I draw my bow, aiming for its neck - but to my horror, it raises its neck to swallow a chunk of the animal it has perched upon just as the arrow is let loose. The Roc turns its head, its piercing yellow eyes observing its surroundings. It is only a matter of time until it sees me - my next move could be my last."

Though on the surface of it they might seem like an easy enough beast to hunt, one must not forget that they live upon the side of gigantic cliffs that are an ordeal for even the most experienced of mountaineers. And of course, one never fights a gargoyle alone, for they are creatures of a social temperament. Their strength, speed and durability is a frightening combination of traits and a single mistake can leave a would-be slayer dead as quick as lightning. Success will depend on a mix of caution, skill and a dash of luck."

Alas, to do so would mean allowing the gargoyles a chance to regain their bearings and so I grit my teeth and bring my weapon down upon the horrendous beasts time and time again. By the time I am done the gargoyle's corpse is pinned to the rockface, and the savagery of the blows has left its stone scales cracked and oozing blue ichor.

In fact as we pass each log or boulder a cold shilver is sent through my spine, the Doyarchu is a master of the ambush. The stillness is broken by the sound of water splashing and as I turn to see the source, the characteristic lizard like tail of a Doyarchu slinks into the deep, its ugly head rearing out of the marsh bearing dagger like teeth."
 doyarchu_victory_desc:0 "I grab my spear and hold it above my head, backing away from the edge of the water, so that the creature may not drag me into the marsh and surely to my demise. The creature submerges itself again but in the shallow water I make can make its shape out, as it swims into a nearby bank obscured by a thick patch of reeds. Any movement and I must react swiftly, if the creature believes itself to be on the back foot it will call for the assistance of others nearby. After a few eerie minutes of silence, the Doyarchu thinking it has the advantage of suprise pounces and at the same time I release my spear, its tip hitting the beast between the eyes, its body with its mouth open and paws outstretched almost hitting me as momentum carries it forwards."

But as I try to climb the bank, the mud below me shifts and I come tumbling back towards the water's edge, the creature now within feet. The reeds breaking as I attempt to haul myself up and then it happens. A sudden, sharp pain engulfs my foot and I begin being tugged into the marsh by the Doyarchu. My spear falls from my grasp and into the mud, leaving me with only my two muddied hands. With one last surge of energy, I spin round and punch the beast square on the nose stunning the creature enough for me to dislodge my foot and scramble on the bank"

 damotan_elephant_intro_desc:0 "As I cut my way through the thick, hot jungle, I can hear a stomping in the distance, echoing off of the dense trees. Raising a hand behind me, I slowly creep forward, gripping my spear tightly, and moving slowly and quietly towards the source of the sound. Then, I see it, a massive grey shape moving through the trees, trunk pulling offending branches out of the way, tusks catching the sparse light flowing through the trees. Though moving slowly through the difficult terrain, its weight is still able to carry it forward, crushing whatever stands upon its path. Through the trees, I can see my comrades moving, slowly trying to cut it off from all sides. Once my hunting party has surrounded it, I issue a whistle, and we move in for the kill."
 damotan_elephant_victory_desc:0 "As we move towards it, spears raised, the animal seems to panic, a fear which proves justified as the first points impale its skin. In pain, it trumpets a deafening cry, beginning to stomp and flail as more spears penetrate its grey flesh. As it continues to struggle, its tusk goring an unfortunate hunter, we narrowly dodge it, continuing our relentless assault, poking more and more holes into its skin. Slowly, its movements slow, and it eventually stops, the light fading from its now-glassy eyes. The grey beast is dead. Moving swiftly, I draw a knife, and sever its left tusk from its body, though my men are awarded the other prize."

Though I at first manage to avoid the undirected attacks, I am soon impacted by its massive tusk, the prize I hoped to claim knocking me to the ground. As it lumbers towards me, I do my best to crawl away from it, though I receive a painful kick as I do so, bone seeming to snap, and I am soon joined by several of my fellows on the ground. The beast is allowed to escape as those who were unwounded turn to aiding those who were, and though I have survived, this hunt was a failure."

In immense pain, I welcome the swift fade to blackness, watching the beast's beady gaze as I leave the world behind."

Insects buzz in my ears, their unceasing hums drowning out all other sounds. I know the beast is near, somewhere through the darkness, the sun blocked out by the trees. I look around, head swiveling, left, right. I turn around. Is something moving back there? In the corner of my eye I see a shadow shift, and whirl to face it. Only a trick of the light, for here, I am in the beast's domain, ever vigilant for something which might be hunting me. Another shift, another swift turn, my eyes failing to pierce the blanket of shadow cast by the trees. And then, from behind a bush ahead of me, I hear a roar as a mass of dark fur springs towards me."
 panther_victory_desc:0 "I manage to sidestep the beast, scoring a hit along its side with my sword. The beast growls in pain, and turns to face me once more. The moment has come. It lashes at me with its claws, once, twice, before bounding forth once more, its terrible fangs bared. I raise my weapon as I again evade the beast, and manage to slash its hind leg, a wound which will certainly slow it. /n/nWith its new loss of speed, the beast tries its claws, and I score another hit upon one of its paws. Now visibly limping, the beast exerts its last efforts in an attempt to bite me, opening its mouth for my blade to pierce, a single strike into the creature's brain. Near-instantly, it falls limp, and I wipe the blood from my sword, before skillfully skinning the creature."

 devouring_worm_intro_desc:0 "The Devouring Worm is one of the more terrifying creatures to stalk the deserts of this world. Many tend to be small, only a foot or two in length and as thick as a string of sausages, but some are known to grow large enough to devour a man. They burrow under the sands waiting for prey, then they spring out of the ground, swallow as much as possible, and dive back beneath the sands to devour and digest their meal.\n\nDangerous as they are, they are not impossible to hunt. I walk through the desert, with several nervous attendants in front of me, hitting the ground in front of us with bags of weights tied to long poles. With any luck, a large worm will think it's prey walking across and spring out of the ground to grab it, and my trusty spear will finish the job.\n\nWe pause when we feel the sand shift underneath us, and I ready my spear. We've found a big one, the likes of which even [GetPlayer.GetFaith.HighGodName] has never seen, and it took the bait!"
 devouring_worm_intro_option:0 "I must not fear!"
 devouring_worm_victory_desc:0 "The worm springs from the ground, maw open as it tries to latch onto the bait. The young attendant thinks fast and jerks the bah upward, forcing the worm to rise even higher out of the sand. In under a second, about four feet of it are visible, perfectly vulnerable and exposed. I drive my spear into its body, pushing until the barbed tip emerges through the other side and holds fast.\n\nThe worm tries to sink back underground, but it obviously cannot escape. From then, it is simply a matter of holding the spear and waiting for it to stop struggling. When it is finally dead, we haul the beast to the surface to get a better look at it. Over ten feet long and nearly two feet wide, large enough to swallow a child whole!\n\nThe attendants heft the carcass on their shoulders, and we start walking back the way we came. This will #EMP certainly#! make for a good conversation starter when I get home."

 devouring_worm_defeat_injury_desc:0 "The worm springs from the ground, but not where we thought it would. In an instant, I lose my balance, and I feel something warm and slimy gliding up my leg. I look down, and I see the lips of a large worm's mouth wrapped firmly around my thigh.\n\nOnce the initial shock passes, I pull a knife from my scabbard and start slashing at the worm's hide. The pain makes it panic and retreat downwards, its myriad sharp teeth digging into the flesh of my leg as it sinks. I howl in pain as I start to lose my balance, but I keep stabbing at it. Why won't this damn thing let go?!\n\nAt last, the beast relents and opens its mouth, slinking back underground and leaving naught but some bloodied dust on the surface. I extract my foot from the sand and look at my leg; it's covered in deep, bleeding lacerations from all sides, some going down to the bone, while me foot hangs limply below it. My attendants haphazardly bandage it as best as they can and carry me back the way we came, racing to get medical attention.\n\n"If we hurry, we might be able to save your foot, sire.""

All that emerges from my mouth is a hideous scream as I slip beneath the sands.\n\nI cannot have sunk far, only a foot or two below the surface. But I cannot see or hear anything, and all I feel is pain as the beast's teeth tear at the flesh of my legs. I am vaguely aware of the vibrations of frantic digging above me.

 dreadleech_intro_desc:0 "The dreadleech seems like something from a nightmare, a shadowy monster that will come upon its hapless victim under the cover of night, inflicting a painful and exceedingly slow death. They are large creatures, generally capable of fitting multiple adult humans within them, though they do not kill through eating. Instead, they come upon their prey in the darkness of night, and drain their blood from their body entirely. They prefer to target the sleeping, immobile, or wounded, wandering the deep jungles until they find their victim.\n\nIn order to hunt such a creature, a plan has been devised. I have prepared a trap for the creature, in the form of a pig tied beside a campfire, brought for this specific purpose. When the beast approaches, it will feast upon the pig, and we can emerge from the surrounding treetops to kill the beast. After hours of waiting, eyes watching the darkness, I see a shadowy mass moving beyond the firelight, and the pig begins squealing.\n\nAnd then, a massive black shape emerges into the dim glow, and I behold a leech the size of a building, moving with suprising swiftness as it slides across the ground towards the unfotunate pig..."

The beast, still draining blood from the sqealing pig, raises its "head" towards me, ignoring the wound I have left upon its suprisingly-tough skin. The massive creature charges, still moving with its suprising speed, and I narrowly manage to sidestep its attack.\n\nAs it rushes by, one of my companions scores another hit, spear sinking deep into the dreadleech's side. It turns once more, dropping the drained pig, and rushes towards me once more. Raising my spear, I step out of the way and cut a gash across the creature, now leaking its precious blood from its many wounds. After a few more evasions, the monstrosity exerting its last energies chasing me, it slows, and eventually ceases to move.\n\nI have slain the horrifying dreadleech of Cyrat!"

As they continue to do battle with the creature, I scramble for my spear, and use it as a crutch as I climb unsteadily to my feet.

Cursed by the witch and outlaw Myra the Crow with her last words to rise from the dead when Aervalr was at its fullest and never know the rest of death. And so the Wild Hunt emerges as a ghostly horde terrorizing rural Malcois as they had done in their living heyday, sparing no Aversarian, Iyrossi, or human in general from the ghastly torments normally only thought possible in nightmares. The Wild Hunt makes no effort to conceal itself instead burned farmsteads, smashed remains and ransacked villages are left scattered in its wake. At its head, the disgraced Legon Agros the Fierce is supposed to ride, his face obscured by an imposing antlered helm. Taking this wave of fury and steel head on would be suicide, instead to 'defeat' such a foe we will need to free them from the invisible chains, keeping them trapped among the living.\n\nTo approach this daunting task we have enlisted the help of a local shaman capable of identifying the source of a Wild Rider's curse, our surroundings becoming increasingly desolate as he, guided by spirits, leads us to the scene of this long-forgotten tragedy. Just as it seems we cannot get anymore isolated the shaman gets on his knees and touches the ground with his palm, the wind picking up and blowing violently through the leaves. We give the shaman a shovel and before long he lifts out a long, rusted chain presumably used to bind one of the Wild Riders' victims. As if the hunt can sense this however, our shouts of joy are turned to those of terror as the unmistakable sound of phantom hooves come thundering towards us. "

 wildhunt_encyclopedia_desc:0 "Purportedly the cursed spirits of what was once [aversaria|E]'s sixth state legion, the 'Wild Riders', the spectral phenomenon known as the Wild Hunt has haunted the plains and backwoods of Malcois for centuries, and its origin story is one of the most well-known fables of the region. Tasked almost exclusively with the hunting down of renegade slaves and quashing uprisings, the methods employed by the Wild Riders were so infamous for their viciousness that it had earned the legion several imperial censures for "Improper Conduct" (an exceptionally rare charge that it shares with only a select with other legions) during its existence. It would ultimately disappear from records in the 5th century IS, the number VI joining the ranks of the "Forbidden Numbers" that are vacant in perpetuity by imperial decree, though the reasoning behind this move and whether it is related to their folk-tale demise is lost to time.\n\nFor all their cruelty and hubris, the Wild Riders would allegedly meet a fittingly grisly end - cursed by the witch and outlaw Myra the Crow with her last words to rise from the dead when Aervalr was at its fullest and never know the rest of death. And so the Wild Hunt emerges as a ghostly horde terrorizing rural Malcois as they had done in their living heyday, sparing no Aversarian, Iyrossi, or human in general from the ghastly torments normally only thought possible in nightmares."

At first it is only the usual culprits which appear, rats, foxes and a whole host of insects; but just when that old Malcoisiac saying seems to have failed us, we hear it, the unmistakable cry of a Morrigna in all its horror."

As I clutch my dagger, the Morrigna digs its beak into my hand and I let go, the creature beating its wings wildly hardly able to lift off. Not ready to give up, I follow the Morrigna's sharp red eyes through the treeline and ready my arrow, releasing at just the right moment for the bird to come crashing down onto the undergrowth below.

From where we've hidden ourselves in the rocks, just above the coast of the Brass Sea, three of the beasts suckle on the juices of a corpse, while wrapping it in webbing excreted from their tail end. Their dark, outer carapaces shimmer under the bright sun, wet from the rising tide. Each of the creature's six legs scamper through the the sand, shifting and jumping with a frenzied hunger. Not far along the coast, the opening of a massive cave yawns, most likely their nest. It is said that the ukhinbooum are dangerously venomous, and if they manage to latch their elongated snouts into your skin, it won't matter if they kill you themselves there and now, the toxins will do it for them. Our best chance for victory will be to strike with surprise on our side, and kill the creature as quick as we can."

We do not have luck to take them down before they escape, their spindly legs proving more than capable to flee into the distance. My companions managed to hit the beast once, though unfortunately missed the others, and we quickly spring from our hiding spot and make for our prey. The poor dog struggles to stand in the dirt, its legs shake underneath it as blood trickles onto the ground from its side.

 ubir_intro_desc:0 "Ubirs are known to be bloodthirsty, repulsive creatures, commonly found in the Aironoian steppe digging through the rotting corpses of recent battles. Stories speak of the monsters sneaking into villages under the cover of night to take children back to its lair. We followed these rumors and treked through the fetid, bloodsoaked battlefields of the steppe hunting our quarry. When all hope seemed lost for finding this horrific creature, luck seemed on our side.\n\nA few miles south of the last battlefield we searched, one of my companion's discovered a shoddy, nearly crumbled cave entrance, hidden by the tall grass. The cave's mouth seems dug out from the earth, almost a straight drop down beneath its surface. The putrid air escaping from beneath the dirt almost makes me gag the closer I come to the cave. If we hope to find this monster, this will be our best chance, but I cannot say I like the odds of fighting such a creature in its lair. We must be cautious, and ready to strike if we hope to survive."
 ubir_victory_desc:0 "I climb down the hole first, jumping downward into the dark. The putrid stench that hung in the air above aground overloads my head down here, causing me to cough and gag the instant I land. I can't tell who, but someone vomits once they land beside me. Steadying my breath, I cover my nose and mouth with a thin cloth and unsheathe my blade, my companions doing the same as one of them prepares a torch. With light finally illuminating the space around us, I feel the crampness of the space more. The rock seems damp, though not with water, as touching the wall leaves a slimy residue on my fingers. We trudge deeper, careful to place our steps to not alert what lurks here in the dark. I can feel my heart drum against my chest, the tension in my muscles rising the further we go. The smell grows worse too, making it almost impossible to breathe easy here. I feel a squelch beneath my foot, and refuse to look down and inspect what I've stepped in, focusing instead on the path ahead.\n\nIt does not take long for the tunnel to open wider, and the closer we get to what lays on its other side, the more squelches and bursts of liquid I hear. Not just beneath our feet, but ahead of us too. My companion trips over something and our torch tumbles ahead of him, rolling against the carved ruins of a poor soul's torso. A raspy echo, followed by clicking and gnawing rises from behind the corpse remains, and I clench my blade tight. My companion scrambles up from the ground, grabbing the torch as they do to better illuminate the space we're in. As they do, the full horror of it hits us.\n\nA mound of decrepit organs, limbs, and refuse lay ahead of us. Some fresher than others, as if cut from their body only this morning. I barely have time to process my disgust before a screech rips through my ears. Just a top the mound, a sinewy creature stands, its skin ruddy and blotched with can only be described as bile and pus. Its long snout comes to a dagger sharp point, dripping with thick, black blood. No eyes stare back at us from its sockets, only a blood curdling hunger for the smell of our flesh. A massive postule of pus and blood lay on its back, almost glowing in the torch light with a sickly color. My throat catches at the sight, and in our moment of surprise the Ubir raises its spindly, elongated arms and lunges at us. I barely have time to move, dodging out of its murderous path and landing against the wall behind me. The ubir doesn't falter in its aggression, swinging its arms violently at each of us. It manages to catch one of my companions in its grip, and as the beast is about to stab its beak deep into his neck, I take my chances and thrust hard into the postule on its back. A smell worse than that of the corpses around us escapes first, nearly causing me to faint in revulsion, but I hold steady, pushing as hard as I can with my blade until I feel it stab into the ubir's bone. The creature screeches again, letting my companion free as it swings wildly at me, unable to reach me with its claws. Those who can still stand their own jump at our prey, stabbing deep into its stomach and torso until the only sound left in the cave is the gas and purge fluid gushes from its backside. I cleave the monster's head off as it lay in the dirt, taking it with us as we climb back to the fresh air of the surface."

Someone managed to injure it, as the screeching does not relent despite the creature struggling to rise from its fall.

Once the sun and fresh air hit us like a rejuvenating potion a top the surface, I feel stronger, but not enough to turn back.

These flats are said to be something of a hunting ground for the karankoncolos- stories of travelers disappearing into the dirt are almost too common in the nearby villages. Tales of ghouls lurking in the night, taking cattle. We dismount and tie our mounts to a boulder laying at the nearest mountain's feet, and ready our weapons. I scan the empty horizon, the sun setting behind us. Every step must be careful and calculated, lest the ghouls we hunt grab us from below the earth, and pull us to our deaths."

The sun sinks under the horizon, only a burnt orange haze hangs through the sky. Wind beats against me, howling into my ears from across the plains. I glance at my companions as we walk, my eyes keen for any disturbances in the dirt underfoot. We enter what seems a bowl in the flats, a soft ridge and smooth incline slide downward to where a lone tree has taken root. Just to the left of its roots, the soil moves ever so lightly I almost do not notice. I motion to my companions and we encircle the tree, the tension feels so taut in my limbs that a crow might even frighten me now.\n\nSuddenly, we hear our mounts wailing from where we had tied them and sprint back in case it were the karankoncolos. I can see the top half of one being dragged into the dirt with a frightened scream as massive arms, two times that of a man, grab the poor beast by its neck and pulls deeper. I dash for the monster, spear ready to pierce through whatever I can hit, when something catches my foot and sends me sprawling onto the ground. I turn to look and see our prey in all its deformity- a disgusting mistake for a human face stares at me with its mouth wide open, a gurgle of black bile spilling from between its teeth. Against the setting sun, its massive arms look burnt and scared, and far too similar to mine own. I swing my spear around and point it at the beasts neck, kicking into its gut at the same time to avoid being dragged too deep. With a furious scream I lunge into the karankoncolos, the beast tries to grab hold of my spear with another hand it had hidden, but it is far too slow. I pierce through its gullet, a sickly ichor spilling from the wound. The creature reels and tries to dig back into the earth, but I grab hold of its neck and pull as I climb back from its shallow hole. The karankoncolos howls against me as its neck skin rips around its wounds, and manages to graze me with its larger, muscular hands, scratching a wound into my arm. My companions have managed to light torches, scaring off our other attackers, and once they see me and my prey break from the dirt, they quickly set upon the beast with blades and fire. The karankoncolos screams and wails as it dies in the dirt, and once the last of its strength has drained from its velicose veins, I wrench my dagger through its neck wound and cut its head free.

We've readied [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] with hooked tips, and plenty of rope to drag the monster down if it attempts to fly away, though only trial will tell us if we're strong enough to bring it down.\n\nAfter a short ride on horse back, we dismount at the base of the cliffs. Their rocky top side bend into the sky like curled fingers, guarding what's hidden amongst the stone. The climb is tough, though far from treacherous, a trail of sweat beads on my brow by the time we reach what seems a palm for the fingers. I ready my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] as we skulk through the rock face, the setting sun above our heads shines just so through the crevices that the shadows seem deeper. With every step I can hear the dirt and pebble crunch underfoot. It is quiet in the rocks. We climb higher, and over my shoulder I can see the vast steppe beyond the cliffs. When I turn back to the rocks, a new sound trickles into my ear; snoring. While I cannot help but feel a rush at the thought of killing such a grand beast as a zilant, we must be cautious and cunning if we hope to not only survive, but also emerge victorious."
 zilant_victory_desc:0 "We creep forward at a crawl, and use a small boulder to spy our quarry. The zilant lay curled in a circle within its nest, bones fresh and old strewn around its homestead. Up close, it's hard to tell if the beast is quite a dragon or not- its body is covered in gray scale blotted with feathers, though its legs remind me more of a rooster, though several times larger, with claws that could easily carve me in two. The beast's wings look soaked with blood in their deep, red color, a contrast to its otherwise muted form. I focus on the beast's face, a groan softly emanating from its beak as it sleeps. I take extra caution as I raise my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))], and aim upon its unguarded neck.

I can feel my throat seize I steal a glance at my companions, who've made ready themselves, but as I turn to look at the zilant, I notice it has opened its eye. A brilliant shimmer of amber glistens across its surface as the thin slit of a pupil stares into me. I steady my breathing and re-aim upon the zilant before letting loose. The beast screeches an ear shattering wail as the [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] pierces just above its collar bone, not far from the mark I hoped. I grab hold of the rope at its end and try to pull the beast down towards the ground as it rises from its nest with a furious rage, spreading its horrific wings before us in glorious display.\n\nMy companions try to shoot the beast down before it takes flight as I pull on the rope until it feels near to snap. The [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] helplessly pierce into the zilant, though provide no respite from its assault as the ferocious dragon lunges directly at me with its razor sharp talons extended.\n\nAs if propelled by an innate will to live, I use my hold on the rope to swing my body out of the lunging beast's path, and around to its side. I use this moment of oppurtunity to unsheathe the blade at my hip, and with my free hand I use the blade to stab deep into the zilants side. The beast roars again and tries to throw me off its back, though I do not budge as my companion's descend upon the zilant's once imposing form. We send a flurry of strikes upon it, piercing and cutting where we can until it finally collapses into the dirt. With heavy breath, and a few scrapes of my own, I cut the beast's head from its neck and claim it as my prize."

 manzasiri_name:0 "Manzaširi"
 manzasiri_intro_desc:0 "The Manzaširi is said to be a giant made of volcanic rock that trudges through the rocky canyons that border the #BOL Redlands#! to Aironoi's south. The scant few locals of the region either refused to speak to us, or couldn't quite understand what we were hunting, until a hermit insisted we follow him to his home. We did so, crossing over a hill where the dirt and sand have mixed into a burnt orange. Before us, a small shack made of mudbrick sits beneath a domineering plateau split through its middle. The hut resembles an ant crawling underfoot against the sheer rock face. The man speaks of the Manzaširi taking roost in the ravine that separates the plateau before us, and offers his land for camping through the night. We accept, and prepare throughout the night, oiling our weapons and checking our armor for weaknesses. The plan is to take the Manzaširi from the rear, knocking it down to the ground and shattering its hard exterior with blunt weaponry until its heart leaks into the sand. These giants are said to be ferocious and bloodthirsty, so if we wish to claim victory tomorrow, we must be the same. Otherwise, the giant will crush us beneath its foot."
 manzasiri_victory_desc:0 "The morning sun had just crept over the horizon when we set out into the canyon. A haze hung high above the rocks on our approach, but by the time we entered the pass, the sky had turned almost violet in its discoloration. The pass itself was large enough to fit nearly a dozen mounts through it, shoulder to shoulder, yet its sheer height on either side of us still managed to make me feel uneasy. A low hum brushes the rock walls around us as we step deeper, the crunch of brittle dirt beneath our feet the only other sound to be heard. Larger boulders dot the divided plateau, forcing us to climb over and through them to go any further to our goal. A layer of sweat sticks to me throughout, as if the heat is rising as we go. The low hum feels stronger this far into the rocks. I struggle to the top of a particularly large boulder and spy a beautiful, obsidian monument far ahead of us, and point it out to my companions. I slide down, briefly thinking that the monument could be just that, but remember the tale the hermit spoke of the Manzaširi being darker than the night sky, and ready my hammer.\n\nWe dart from behind the rocks, blunt instruments swung far behind us to carry our momentum into the manzasiris side with fury. They connect with the giant's hardened exterior, shattering its limb into a glittering haze of obsidian shards that shower us. I roll to the side to avoid the rain of daggers, though some still manage to leave open wounds across my body. The manzasiri roars, shaking the very walls around us as its legs nearly buckle beneath it. I swing my hammer as I come out of the roll, aiming for what I think is the colossus' knee cap, and land my blow with a resounding whack that splinters the sleek rock. I move backwards to avoid the manzasiri's fall, the towering figure sending a shockwave through the ground as it lands in the dirt that knocks me and my companions off our feet. With an outreached hand, the giant manages to grab my lower half, but I scramble free from its grip before it has time to crush me into juice, and slam its hand back into the dirt before walloping on its back side. My companions take a moment to recover from the shockwave before joining me in cracking the giant's chest, all of us sending splinters and breaks through the black rock as the walls and earth around us seem to vibrate with the pain in the manzasiri's voice. I raise my hammer high above me and throw all I have into its swing downwards, punching through the rock once and for all. My hammer becomes stuck in the manzasiri's backside, and I as try to pull it free, lava begins to pool out of the wound. My hammer melts almost immediately into the molten rock, the manzasiri purging more from its mouth that spreads around its dying form. I quickly grab large shards before the heat  becomes too much to bear, and we make way for the pass' entrance, victorious."

Outsiders to the region that have survived encounters with the giants often confused them with golems due to their appearance, though little else aligns. They are far from compassionate nor caring beings, often seeming apathetic and outright cruel to the world around them. Folk tales speak of the giant that tried to the eat the sun, but was cast down, and never grew past its contempt for the gods that denied it its pleasure."

 cor_name:0 "Çor"
 cor_intro_desc:0 "Following the advice of locals who claimed the Çor stalked the pitch black tunnels of a nearby cave, we set out in search. It took hours to find the cavern they spoke of, the only noticable feature being a sort of hawk-shaped rune above its mouth. With deep breaths and steady hands, we step into the darkened tunnel. Torchlight flickers across the cave walls, and I see faces and creatures dancing in the corner of my eyes. It is said that the Çor plays tricks on the mind, and one must be swift of thought if they wish to slay it. Otherwise, they may lose themselves in the process. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest with every step we take deeper into this underworld, and we soon come upon a small, cramped hole, a tight and jagged crevice leading deeper. If we are to find this monster, we'll have to climb through individually, but it will not be easy to turn back from here. We must be ready."
 cor_victory_desc:0 "I struggle through the crack first, moving and breathing slow as I feel the rock drag and scratch against me. I hear something whisper my name as if in passing and dart my head backwards to my companions. They did not say it. Upon exiting to the other side, my companion passes me the first torch and I can see the cavern beyond us. A deep, dark hole that seems to go on forever into the earth sits only twenty paces from us. I yell my name and can hear it echo across its walls as I stand at the edge. Somewhere buried in the echo, I hear another whisper. A voice. I spin around as the first of my companions comes through the crack, beckoning the next, and scan our surroundings. I unsheathe my blade as I turn, the twisting flames of my torch licking at the corners of my face as I do, like they're pulled by the shadows around us. My companion asks if I heard a voice speaking just now. I turn to look at them just as the flames of their torch seem to drip onto their hand. They scream, dropping the torch in the process which rolls in my direction. Laughter erupts from the walls around me, though my companions do not seem to notice. One screams and flings their weapon against the rock wall, clawing at something on their face beyond the torchlight. I move closer and see nothing, only their fingers digging into their skin. The torch in my hand suddenly roars at my face with the image of a beast in its flames and I toss it as well, the flame landing near the other. I curse under my breath, calling for my companions to move nearer the flame.\n\nNo sound rises from my mouth to my ears, though I hear my companions reply. I grip my blade tight, looking for any sign of the monster plaguing our minds. A gust of wind blows through the crack, though the flames of our torches do not go out. The thought of it lingers in my mind, as I turn to look down at the torches. What once were the tips of the flames turn to snakes, hissing as they slither at our feet. We each yelp in shock, slashing and cutting with all we have at the creatures until they suddenly fade into the shadow, the torch light remaining. More images and beasts seem to pour through the walls, clawing their way towards us like a miasma of sorrow. Each appears more hideous than the last. My companions do their best to cut the monsters down as our shadows dance across the cavernous pit against the growing flame in the middle. I see a face shimmer in the fire once again, and quickly realize the error we made; Çors live in fire.\n\nWith a renewed sense of fury to escape this hell, I fling myself towards the flame, blade extended in a piercing thrust. My companions yell for me not to put the light out as they struggle against the demons set upon us, but I see the truth. I stab through the flames just as they rise up to meet my assault, and cut through their remnants. A wail pierces my ears, like knives scratching the inside of my skull. The once glorious fire fades into a cinder on the ground, and though light would have been preferable, we decide to climb back to the surface without torches. I take a small, amber-colored rock that had fallen amongst the char, and make way to the exit."

 karkadann_intro_desc:0 "Just beyond the hillcrest that we've hidden behind, our quarry grazes in the low shrubbery. The other animals nearby have stayed clear of the monstrous karkadann, a lonely male who has been in search of a mate. The karkadann is very similar in to its smaller cousin, the rhinoceros, but far more treacherous to hunt. Its massive horn seems more like a sharpened blade, cut to a fine point at its tip. The sheer size of the beast seems insurmountable, its lean, muscular build easily dwarfing us. The karkadann has little care for the surrounding fauna, as it is well aware of its dominance in the animal world. As the beast trudges through a narrow creek bed, it pays no mind to several fearful zebras that pass it by in a hurry. If we hope to win, we must act with cunning, and a hint of surprise. I aim my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] upon its chest, my companions doing the same. It will take far more than one to bring this beast down."

My companions quickly follow, though our attacks are not enough to bring it down. The karkadann lets out a deep, monstrous roar, rearing itself into the air and landing with such force that I could feel it through the ground. As if aware of our position, the beast turns to us and charges. We yelp in surprise at its sudden ferocity and quickly flee the hillside, readying more [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] as we go, the karkadaan in hot pursuit.\n\n I struggle to keep my feet even as I ready my shot, turning my head now and again to tell how close the beast is getting. It's crossed the hill. With a clear shot and enough distance between us, I spin and aim at it once again, letting loose. The karkadann roars as my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] pierces its neck, but barely falters, and I have no choice but to flee. My companions pepper the beast as it chases me, slowing it ever so slightly so it does not catch up to me. They stand over a small ridge overlooking a rocky descent to a river below, and I race in their direction. The moment I reach them, my companions dive to their sides, and I try my best to do the same as the karkadann reaches our position. I can feel its hard skin brush through the air past us as I land in the grass and it charges over the ridge into the river below. I can hear it moan and roar as it lands, and quickly gather up my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_name'))] and look over the ridge's side to see the karkadann rising from the water, still alive. Refusing to give up, I aim down upon its head and back, my companions doing the same, as we let loose what [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] we have left. It takes half a dozen more before the beast slumps into the water, unmoving, and we sprint down the ridge towards it. It's still breathing once we arrive, but I take my blade and thrust it into the karkadann's throat with force, and the beast breathes its last."

My companions quickly follow, though our attacks are not enough to bring it down. The karkadann lets out a deep, monstrous roar, rearing itself into the air and landing with such force that I could feel it through the ground. As if aware of our position, the beast turns to us and charges. We yelp in surprise at its sudden ferocity and quickly flee the hillside, readying more [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] as we go, the karkadaan in hot pursuit.\n\n I struggle to keep my feet even as I ready my shot, turning my head now and again to tell how close the beast is getting.

The karkadann roars as my [Localize(Concatenate(GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('long_range_weapon').GetFlagName,'_ammo'))] pierces its neck, but barely falters, and I have no choice but to flee. My companions pepper the beast as it chases after me, slowing it ever so slightly so it does not catch up to me. They stand over a small ridge overlooking a rocky descent to a river below, and I race in their direction. The moment I reach them, my companions dive to their sides, and I try my best to do the same as the karkadann reaches our position. My dive proved less than effective, as the beast's horn catches my leg in its bullheaded charge off the ridge down toward the river below. Luckily, it does not take me with it, though it claims a chunk of my leg, and breaks what I can only assume are most of my leg's bones. Rather than wait for the beast to get up and find us, my companions quickly gather me and we flee for our mounts, hoping to still escape death."

There's no time to move, no time to regret, and none to brace myself as its full force comes crashing into my body. Pain eviscerates me as the karkadann's blade like horn splits my body in two, sending my lower half into the dirt, and my upper sailing through the air in a shower of blood.

While they are both incredibly bulky, massive creatures, the karkadann is far more lean, and its horn more reminiscent of a blade, than the cone like horns of the rhino. Karkadanns are often solitary creatures, migrating across long distances in search of a mate that they spend little time with before continuing on their journey. While uncaring for most fauna that they encounter, Karkadanns can be highly aggressive and territorial if they feel threatened, and it is safer for would be travellers to avoid encounters with these beasts altogether."

 gaunt_intro_desc:0 "The Gaunt is a dangerous opponent, its natural flight makes it difficult to get to grips with, and it's tough leathery skin, sharp horns, and vicious claws make it hard to harm even once in close against them. A colony of gaunts is even moreso, with each working in concert to kill intruders, and covering for each other's weaknesses. It is perhaps in their cavernous homes where the greatest opportunity to weaken the gaunt colony arises, with a well placed fire, the colony could be smoked out and dealt with in their confusion.\n\nAs my hunting party and I approach the steep crag where the beasts are residing, I quietly motion for a few members of the party to bring tinder for the fire. In a few minutes a roaring conflagration has filled the sky with smoke. The caves too have been smoked out, as a number of the creatures come shrieking out into the sky.\n\nMost of the hunting party remains silent, awaiting my first shot. I ready my bow, and steel my nerves, preparing to start the attack."
 gaunt_victory_desc:0 "My first shot pierces the air, whistling past the largest of the gaunts, with the rest of my party joining in the attack.

As I fell another of the beasts, a particularly large gaunt spits and hisses at me, lurching forward to attack. I narrowly avoid its claws, readying my blade, the beast again slashes at me narrowly missing my shoulder, and leaving it exposed. I swing my blade, cleanly decapitating the monster.

The survivors of my party are struggling desperately not to exterminate the gaunts, but merely to survive.\n\nSeeing that I have lost the battle, I shout for my surviving comrades to take flight. One of the creatures notices me, attempts to take me into the sky and kill me there. My reflexes are too quick for the monster however and instead we are locked in a bitter melee. The creature delivers a vicious slash across my face and chest leaving a deep gash, but I drive my sword into the beast's chest, piercing its heart. It dies with a shudder, and with a few more well placed arrows I provide enough of an opening for the few survivors of my party and I to escape with our lives, though most of us are grievously injured."

The beast doesn't seem to observe my approach and I prepare to pounce on it."

The point strikes true driving deep into the creature's guts, with foul smelling ichorous fluids spilling onto the ground.

Many stories tell of how vicious and powerful these monsters can be, and if we're not careful on the mountain paths, it will not take much for the beast to send us hurdling downward to our deaths."

As we set foot into a long, curved path that goes along the mountains edge, I see the Almas. It stands almost taller than a tree, with lanky arms and longer legs supporting a bulbous stomach and torso that look stuffed and fat. It's claws shimmer in the light, their curled tips looking almost jagged in their sharpness. Its face almost looks like any of ours- eyes, ears, nose, lips, but its flattened, as if someone smushed its face in at birth.

The almas turns to face us, and at first lunges at me with its claws, but my companions pierce into its sides from behind. The beast howls in pain, collapsing to one knee, and I take the moment to thrust with all I have into its front. My spear pierces between its ribcage and I keep pushing, the almas roaring and thrashing as my companions do the same.

It is said that a Gajara's only weakness is its great milky eyes, its skin thicker than any armour.\n\n All thoughts of rumours fade from my party's minds when we first lay eyes upon this particular Gajara. It sits on the stump of a tree, idly yet ferociously ripping apart its latest victim. As the child in its tusked maws is devoured, I realise that it will not be long until it sees me.\n\nI have my doubts that such a creature could be killed by my bow now that I can see it in the flesh, but I can only try."

It paces awkwardly around an ancient tree, the shape of a man but with wasps ripping out from its flesh and slamming back in with every beat of my heart.

When it drops from the sky once again, I throw out my arm to where I know the shaft of my arrow remains lodged. As we collide, I make contact with the wood, and shove the arrow deeper into the Kursha's leg. The beast looks around at me and bits into my arm.\n\nDespite the pain, I manage to push the beast's head into the mountain side, shattering its hold. It flies away, presumably to find its pack and return for the kill. Not wishing to give it the opportunity, I slip away down the mountain face, wounded and unrewarded but still alive."

I painfully drag myself to my feet to defend myself, unarmed and unprepared.\n\nAs it swoops down toward me again, I hold out my hands in front of me to block its paws. Its massive jaws clamp down upon my hand and begin to hoist me up as I stare helplessly up into the blaring sunlight.

This particular Akapura has only recently awoken, its luminous head visible above the waves whilst its limbs remain inside its shell. Whilst there is little danger of losing sight of the creature, there are no guarantees as to how killing it will proceed.\n\nI have prepared a bomb for my task. The shell of the Akapura is nearly as strong as stone, and its limbs are thick and scaly: the only way I could truly kill such a beast is from the inside. Armed with climbing spikes, a dagger, and a well-wrapped bomb, I make my way to the shore.\n\nAs I remove all but the most basic of my clothes, I can only hope that my skill serves me well when I dive into its domain."

The Akapura groans at the blade as if confused and annoyed, but then suddenly grows still.\n\nThe creature opens up its jaws as expected, and I swim into its mouth. When its beak closes, I am stuck in complete darkness. As my lungs begin to fail, the water around me is sucked deeper into the Akapura, and I along with it. Entering the rim of its stomach, I can finally complete my task.\n\nWith the water drained around me, I find no issue in leaving the bomb upon a raised piece of flesh. The volatile mixture will eventually fall into the acid below and kill the creature. Content in my purpose, I pull the climbing spikes from the rope around my chest and begin my return to the surface. The monster rumbles from within as the spikes make contact with its delicate gullet, but the spikes seem to remain firm.\n\nAt one particularly loud rumble, a spike nearly slips from my hand. Luckily, I manage to hold on and continue my trek up to freedom. As I reach the beak, I see light again while the Akapura moans in pain. I swim as desperately as I can through the water and back to the shore, so close to death at every moment.\n\nAs the giant turtle explodes from within, I cannot help but smile as I look upon the once-great creature turned into a hollow shell."

The reason behind this behavior is not clear, as are most things about the monster - mostly stemming from the fact that their habitat in the upper North Kharadan mountains is extremely seldom visited by humans, allowing for mercifully little contact.\n\nThe creatures also display a significant variability in size, with the largest known living blizzard, Setokhin 'the White Devourer' being so large that it is capable of hiding entire mountains within its snowy maw.

If we are too rash, the other elephants might take notice and decide to intervene, but the goal is to take the beast down with speed. This bull would last for hours if our shots were not accurate, provided it did not manage to skewer us all. I make ready a spool of rope weighted at one end, my companions doing the same, furtively moving towards the lumbering form of our prey. The closer we get, the larger its tusks seem to grow- long enough to carry our group if the elephant wished. Slowly, to not draw the beast's attention, we wrap part of the tree in rope and wrap more around two others near it, in hopes to trip the elephant once it attempts to flee. We ready torches, unlit, nearby in the tall grass to scare the beast once it has awoken, and grip the rough rope to pull the tree under the elephant's weight."

Though on the ground, its tusks make it far from defenseless. I watch for a moment to strike when my companion thrusts with their torch, causing the elephant to rear its head backwards. I take the chance and thrust hard into its throat. The elephant roars and thrashes, tossing me to the ground once before I pierce its hide again, my companions soon following.

Even constellations low on the horizon like the north polar Crown are completely unaffected by their position, being as clear and visible as if they were directly overhead.\n\nThe effect, however, is hardly exclusive to the sky. Massive populations of variously-colored glow-coral and bioluminescent marine creatures light up the ocean to a level that almost matches the celestial firmament. The water clarity means that one can see every single shoal of glowing fish down to the equally brightly-lit bottom in a bedazzling array of colors, though with the noted characteristic that creatures of a similar color often cluster together. Even on land, flora with glowing flowers illuminates the jungle to such an extent that visibility often becomes better than during the day."
