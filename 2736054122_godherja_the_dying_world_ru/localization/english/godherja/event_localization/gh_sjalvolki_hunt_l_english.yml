 sjalvolki_hunt.7003.desc:0 "We've been traveling through the wilderness for several weeks now, tracking our quarry through rough terrain far from civilization. Just as I'm thinking of ordering us to set up camp, one of the scouts I sent ahead returns, excitedly crashing through the underbrush and bounding into the clearing in which we are gathered. "A ruin! I think it's Aversarian in design. It's a bit out of the way and will take some climbing to reach, but there may be treasure!" I can see the avarice in my men's eyes at just the thought. Though, if we do pursue this 'treasure' - should it exist, we do risk losing the trail."
 sjalvolki_hunt.7003.a:0 "Take me to this ruin at once!"

 sjalvolki_hunt.7004.desc:0 "The days of tracking far from civilization has taken its toll. We ate the last of our dried meat last night, despite best attempts at rationing, and throughout the day our attempts to subsist off local vegetation have failed. There's game around if you know where to look, but taking the time to hunt rabbits and deer risks us losing the trail."

 sjalvolki_hunt.7004.b:0 "We can't hunt on an empty stomach!"

Our camp is filled with barbaric looking men rifling through our things."

Maybe it's the way [hunting_paramour.GetSheHe] is always there with a waterskin when I'm thirsty or rations when I'm hungry. Or maybe it's just the natural result of a small group of people being isolated with only each other as company for weeks on end. Regarldess, it's clear that [hunting_paramour.GetName] feels the same about me."

 sjalvolki_hunt.7007.desc:0 "While trekking back down the mountain from the Simurgh's oasis, we stumbled upon a most surreal sight- a boy, not even old enough for hair on his chin. The boy is crying his heart out, though there's no way to know from where he hails, or how he got here. If left here, they will surely perish. We could bring them back home, or leave them at the village with the wise woman."

 sjalvolki_hunt.7008.desc:0 "Ever since my encounter with that... thing, my mind has not been able to stop racing. Everywhere I go, everywhere I look, I can feel it. Staring at me from the corner of my eyes. Once I turn my head, it's gone, but the feeling remains. It's getting harder to sleep. I have woken in a fright almost every morning since. And even when I tell others of what lurks in my shadows, they simply look worried or fearful. It's all in my head, they say. Well, we shall see about that."
 sjalvolki_hunt.7008.a:0 "It haunts my very soul!"
