 legal_tradition.0001.desc:0 "The case arrives in the usual manner, a scrawny courier lad depositing the papers into a leather satchel outside my door. Cracking the wax seal I settle into my chair to arrange the documents on my desk, and soon I have three neat stacks arranged in front of me.\n\nTo my left sits the testimony and arguments of the defense, to my right is its counterpart from the prosecution, and in between sits the documents containing the relevant passages of Wardenite Law suggested by the forwarding lower court judge. I grimace at the sight and prepare myself for a long night ahead."

 legal_tradition.0011.desc:0 "It seems two of my vassals are at odds with one another again. While it hasn't come to blows quite yet, their hostile maneuverings in the courts certainly seem like a prelude to violence. Naturally, given the grave importance of a proper decision in this matter my magistrates have wisely forwarded the case to me in hopes of getting a definitive ruling.\n\n[actor.GetTitledFirstName] is pushing a writ of claim to [target.GetName], arguing that [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] has demonstrated inadequate stewardship over the land and its people. [actor.GetSheHe] has included some supplementary evidence claiming a distant relation once held claim to the territory as well, and is essentially asking for a re-assessment of an inheritance division from well over a century ago. I must say that I'm a little impressed by the brazenness of their maneuvering."

None of these are crimes of any real import - thieves, coin clippers and drunks make up the majority of these cases, and presiding over them would normally be far below what is expected of someone of my station.\n\nHowever, helping out with clearing this backlog would not just give me an aura of an involved ruler to the locals, but also help build legal experience in an environment where the outcome of the case itself is unlikely to matter in the grand scheme of things."

As I start to read it's all I can do to keep my eyes from losing focus as they scan over the text. Tenths and hundredths of revenues per centile, finder's fees and portions of tariff recompense. A long addendum going over insurance clauses for if goods are transported overseas and lost due to weather, but only should it be mundane in nature...\n\nWarden's Eyes, I hate it when merchants get into financial disputes with one another. Never before have I met a class of people able to turn a quarrel over ludicrous quantities of money into such a mundane affair. Sighing, I rub my temples as I ponder over whether or not to just hand this off to a lower court."

The guild of course disputes this narrative, claiming they're merely utilizing loopholes in the First Laws which were clearly intentionally left by the First Warden to facilitate the business of honest craftsmen, and decrying the efforts of the magistrates to thwart them as illegal tyranny. As I understand it the case has been working its way through lower courts for the better part of the month, with the fact that it would wind up on my desk one way or another being more or less common knowledge.\n\nThe complaints of the magistrates are shrill to the point that you'd think the guild were practicing murder or banditry, and the entreaties of the guild's leaders are worded no less provocatively. Whatever decision I make, it's sure to make somebody angry."

[heterodox_judge.GetSheHe|U] is now preaching all manner of follies which apparently borders on full blown lawless heresy.\n\nWith a heavy sigh I pull the envelope towards me and crack the wax seal with a knife, withdrawing the thin stack of parchment containing testimonials.

 legal_tradition.0561.desc:0 "A messenger arrives before me, clad in the livery of an incredibly minor landholder within my realm. [messenger.GetSheHe|U] bows before me, and presents me with a neatly folded envelope, bearing a partly-melted wax seal.\n\nOpening the letter, I read an extensive legal argument made by said minor landowner, blaming [plaintiff.GetHerHis] immediate overlord for a number of "rights violations", rooting [plaintiff.GetHerHis] arguments in the placement of punctuation within a generations-old contract. A copy of the contract in question was also attached in full, with the relevant passages annotated.\n\nWhile the argument does have some legal merit, the contractual obligations are left vague, most likely by design, and as a result there is nobody clearly in the right, with the "egregious" violations of the landholder's rights being completely within a reasonable interpretation of the law."
 legal_tradition.0561.a:0 "How about I improve this entire contract?"

 legal_tradition.0581.t:0 "Crisis of Inheritance"
 legal_tradition.0581.desc:0 "For hours now I have listened to the bickering and personal attacks of two siblings fighting over the rights to their father's inheritance. While a will was written, explicitly stating the two were to receive equal portions of the land and wealth, the process has stalled over a debate on who gets a small parcel of land in between their domains. One claims that it has always been de jure part of his territory, and brings detailed documents showing how it has been administered in the past, though they date from even before their father's birth.\n\nThe other sibling states that precedent dictate he receive it, as his sibling already controls half of their father's lands, while he does not, thus breaking the rule of their inheritance, though he is unclear on how exactly that is the case. Despite the time we have spent trying to work through this issue, both seem further from reaching an agreement than when we began, and have devolved to hurling insults at each other. It has fallen on me to solve this for them."
 legal_tradition.0581.a:0 "De jure right is law, and he shall receive the land."
 legal_tradition.0581.b:0 "The precedent of your inheritance is clear."

How else am I supposed to run the Wardenite world?"

What had once been the avant-garde of Wardenite thought has grown stale and decrepit, its lustre now long gone.\n\nWith the last supporters of the tradition now themselves dying off as one generation passes the mantle to the next, the school's passage into the realm of historical footnote is all but assured."

 the_pillars_of_virtue_name:0 "The Pillars of Virtue"
 the_pillars_of_virtue_desc:0 "There is enough literature concerning [wardenite|E] law that reading all of it would take even a dedicated student a lifetime to finish. Fortunately, the five works of the [first_warden|E] that form the bedrock of the entire faith — the Three Fathers, Visions and Marginalia — are an uncontroversially starting point for any acolyte's legal studies.\n\nI begin with the [first_warden|E]'s first and most widely read work, the Pillars lay down much of the foundational work of [wardenite|E] doctrine - the Dead God, the Pillars of Virtue, and several of the most basic of moral imperatives of the faith. Luckily for me, it is also considered the most readable of the five canonical works."
 the_book_of_days_name:0 "The Book of Days"
 the_book_of_days_desc:0 "I continue to advance in my legal studies. Under advisement from some of the magistrates in my court I have acquired a copy of The Book of Days, the third and longest of the so called "Three Fathers".\n\nThe Book of Days is widely regarded as the driest of the First Warden's books, and their time studying it is usually viewed with trepidation by most burgeoning legal scholars. The book covers all manner of minutiae in a stilted and awkward style, attempting to cover every possible loophole or exception to the laws and ideas laid out in the First Warden's other texts. Most notorious of all is the massive final half of the book which gives an in-depth guide to all things relating to property, inheritance, and land taxation. Truly a riveting work."
 the_marginalia_name:0 "The Marginalia"
 the_marginalia_desc:0 "Now I move beyond the Three Fathers, onto the Marginalia. Condensed from roughly a dozen smaller works authored by the First Warden and compiled at the hands of the early Mamurs, the fifth of the Canonical works is also the most controversial. Radical sects often coalesce around obscure texts which they claim were also written by the Father of Our Laws, but purposefully excluded from the Canonical Works by the machinations of wicked scholars or Ritualists.\n\nThe somewhat eclectic texts covers a range of topics, and can be very difficult for students to master. On the other side, its ramshackle nature means that there's something in it for almost any kind of reader. From frank discussions of military logistics to poetic retellings of the First Warden's lesser visions, the Marginalia truly contains multitudes."
 the_visions_name:0 "The Visions"
 the_visions_desc:0 "Now I move beyond the Three Fathers, onto the Visions of the First Warden. Considered to be of only marginal legal importance by more conservative scholars, the Visions lays out the core ideological basis of our faith. While the books of laws tell us how to live and rule, the Visions of the First Warden lays out, in vivid and somewhat disturbing detail, why we do these things.\n\nOf course, not all scholars dismiss the tome as an ideological or poetic work. Many metaphoralists have come to the conclusion that the passages contain double meanings which, when analyzed by trained scholars, can give valuable new insights into the law."
 the_records_of_the_first_wardens_court_name:0 "The Records of the First Warden's Court"
 the_records_of_the_first_wardens_court_desc:0 "Next on my plan for legal education comes the Records of the First Warden's Court, helpfully provided for me by one of my local magistrates. The book is considered the second of the "Three Fathers", and an important milestone in any burgeoning legal scholar's education.\n\nThe Records is more or less exactly as it sounds - a study of the cases which passed through the First Warden's court over a period of roughly five years, though modern scholars bicker whether these cover every single case that the Father of our Laws presided over, or just the ones he considered most valuable to record. To a scholarly minded individual, the Records are something of a page turner, filled with demonstrable examples of Wardenite law in action."
