Thanks to the nice nobles who helped me so much with their smarts and armies, father's throne is now mine! My brothers were wrong when they said [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] could not be a High King like father.\n\nI don't know what to do now, but the Council will help me, and they keep telling me [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] have to give them their due for helping me so much. That's alright, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')]'m the High King! [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] can do anything now! Just like father!"

The wars of reunification are done, and good men from both sides now serve as fuel for the pyres as [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] sit on my father's throne. The land is scarred and fractured still, just as my family remains, and [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] can even now hear the whispering of nobles who think they are more silent than they are, or safer in their position, that the Bastard King deserves not to sit on so high a throne.\n\nThey are wrong. Through fire and fury [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] took back my father's throne from those who did not deserve to sit it, and through fire and fury [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] will ensure the realm united and the [liches|E] kept from our borders. If my brothers can never recognize this then it shall stay so, but [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] am the High King, and my rule begins now."

While my brothers thought themselves deserving thanks to age, they can no longer pretend their right is any greater than mine, as [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] sit on a throne and they prostrate themselves before me.\n\nHowever [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] rule is up to me alone, but [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] no doubt have to keep in mind those who got me here.

[ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')]'m excited, and [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] have so many nice people who tell me they will help me in being a High King.\n\nMother is so proud, but Engelmar scares me.
