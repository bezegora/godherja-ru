 iyrossi_monthly.1000.desc:0 "My outriders have caught a bedraggled group composed of almost a dozen Aversarian families attempting to seek shelter from a disaster which has consumed their livelihoods. While they are unarmed and seem harmless, we must remember the commandments of Deiphartoros. Their countrymen kept us in chains and subjected us to cruel torments for centuries, and blood calls for blood. How shall I handle these wretches?"
 iyrossi_monthly.1000.a:0 "These people are innocent, they may stay or go as they please."
 iyrossi_monthly.1000.b:0 "They'll pay off their debt in labor. Land them as indentures."
 iyrossi_monthly.1000.c:0 "Sell them as slaves, they've earned no less."
