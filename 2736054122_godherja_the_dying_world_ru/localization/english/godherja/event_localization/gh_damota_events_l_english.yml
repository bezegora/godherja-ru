 damota.0001.t:0 "The [boqqarut|E] Restored"
 damota.0001.desc:0 "For the first time since the death of Kayoba, a single ruler reigns over all of Damota, from its deepest jungles to its mountainous gates. Once more does the [boqqarut|E] rise in all its splendour, and the people of this vast realm chant my name in unison.\n\nI have done what seemed impossible, I have reforged Eshwo's dream, I have revived a strong state from the chaos and warlordism that so long engulfed it. Now and forever, the [boqqarut_damotada|E] will stand, eternally hailing my name among the ancient greats, as the restorer of our rightful legacy."
 damota.0001.a:0 "Damota shall never more fall!"
 
 damota.0002.t:0 "The Reunification of Damota"
 damota.0002.desc:0 "The jungles of Damota, which have been split between a large number of warring states since the '[etami_tetenik|E]' 861 IS, have once more been unified beneath a single ruler. In a proclamation from the once-fallen capital of Zahali, the new Boqqar has announced that the [boqqarut_damotada|E] stands united once more, and that the people under its reign will once more enjoy their lost glory. \n\nThe possible ramifications of this effect are large, with the Damotans once more able to monopolize the Gonan road. Some speculation has even drifted to the possibilty of an invasion into Sarradon, though most predict that the new [boqqarut|E] will continue the peaceful policies of its predecessors."
 damota.0002.a:0 "The jungle stirs."
 
 damota.0101.t:0 "Karavuux Exploitation"
 damota.0101.desc:0 "It would seem that the [karavuux|E] [karavuux_event_county.GetNameNoTier] have begun to enjoy their dominant position a little bit too much. Practices such as extortionate pricing of even staple goods, demanding "tribute" from local storeowners, and forcing people into bankrupting contracts have become commonplace.\n\nWhile the [karavuux|E] are always... enthusiastic in exploiting their privileges, their behavior in the area has grown beyond the pale even by their own standards. As their liege lord, it is up to me to intervene and bring them under control. Or, I could simply let their power grow, ignoring my people's plight."
 damota.0101.a:0 "This doesn't sound like my problem."
 damota.0101.b:0 "Get them under control!"
 damota.0101.c:0 "Punish them for their actions!"
 damota.0101.d:0 "Join in on the fun!"
 damota.0101.e:0 "Convince them that this isn't sustainable."
 
 damota.0111.t:0 "Greedy Generosity"
 damota.0111.desc:0 "Most likely as an investment for the long term, various [karavuux|E] have donated sizable sums of money to various enterprises and projects within my realm. Though popular with the people, this has the risk of undermining my authority, and so a choice must be made. I could seize the funding, though this would be unpopular with my subjects, or simply allow the donations to happen. I could also join them in investing, and perhaps redirect the goodwill towards myself."
 damota.0111.a:0 "I have better uses for the money."
 damota.0111.b:0 "Let the karavuux help the people."
 damota.0111.c:0 "The investments are a good idea."
 
 damota.0121.t:0 "Overbearing Recruitment"
 damota.0121.desc:0 "A series of recent recruitment pushes by [waranuux|E] within my realm has resulted in a large amount of farmers becoming more devoted to the arts of war. Though a large number of additional troops could be useful, this could pose various problems, as it both undermines my authority and reduces the taxable production of those who have joined. Stopping the recruitment will be unpopular, but might be necessary to secure my authority and income."
 damota.0121.a:0 "They are more useful as farmers."
 damota.0121.b:0 "They can do what they want."
 damota.0121.c:0 "Clamp down, they are out of line."
 
 damota.0131.t:0 "Waranuux Skirmish"
 damota.0131.desc:0 "Two [waranuux|E] within my realm have begun a series of skirmishes over territory. Though ordinarily tolerated, this still poses a threat to my control of the area, and clamping down on them might be better. Of course, them fighting it out could weaken them if pushed too far, so egging them on could have favorable results. Of course, letting them fight it out is always an option, though they will likely gain from such an action."
 damota.0131.a:0 "Let them fight."
 damota.0131.b:0 "Calm them down."
 damota.0131.c:0 "Divide and conquer, spur them on."
 
 damota.0141.t:0 "Qabuux Splitting"
 damota.0141.desc:0 "A relatively powerful local [qabuux|E] within my realm has begun to split, as an internal feud boils over into a local political struggle. While a [qabuux|E] splitting is far from rare, this potential split risks upheaving the local situation, and causing instability which could undermine my popularity. Mending the split, on one hand, risks strenghtening a rival for local authority, though it would likely be popular with the region's inhabitants. Letting the collapse come without intervention, though useful, might be seen as incompetence. The choice, as always, is mine."
 damota.0141.a:0 "Attempt to mediate the feud."
 damota.0141.b:0 "Negotiate a split."
 damota.0141.c:0 "Let them fall."
 
 damota.0151.t:0 "A Matter of Land"
 damota.0151.desc:0 "A growing [qabuux|E] within my realm is seeking to control new land, attempting to use its influence on local trade to strongarm its neighbors. While ordinarily this level of local politics would be below my interest, it seems unlikely that this will be resolved without my intervention, and my advisors are pushing me to take action and settle the dispute. The [qabuux|E] has offered to pay increased taxes to me for a duration should I take their side, however strengthening their power might not be worth it at the moment. Instead, I can try to reach a compromise, or even attempt to contain the [qabuux|E], though this will likely displease them."
 damota.0151.a:0 "Take the bribe."
 damota.0151.b:0 "Find a compromise."
 damota.0151.c:0 "Contain them."
 
 damota.0161.t:0 "A Great Search"
 damota.0161.desc:0 "A local [rayakuux|E] within my realm has chosen to fund a large expedition within my territory, bringing a number of its members to the area to search. As is tradition, such a search will grant them a large amount of power within the region, with their numbers and funds able to overcome my local administration. However, the benefits of such an expedition for the region could be large, with the influx of people and wealth potentially able to improve the local economy and assist in developing the region, which could outweigh the short-term costs. I could even assist the [rayakuux|E] with my own funds, which will both increase my popularity and the benefits of their presence."
 damota.0161.a:0 "Support this expedition"
 damota.0161.b:0 "Let them journey."
 damota.0161.c:0 "Prevent this search."
 
 damota.0171.t:0 "Highwaymen"
 damota.0171.desc:0 "Some [rayakuux|E] within my realm have become the target of several robberies recently, performed against travelers making their customary journeys. As a result, the local [rayakuux|E] leadership has formally requested that I come to their aid, as it is my subjects being robbed. I could use this oppurtunity to institute road patrols in the area, which would strengthen my grip and improve popular perception of me, though it would also have a cost. The rayakuux have offered to compensate me for merely guarding their members, and I could always take this offer, though this would strengthen their local control. Of course, if I wish to weaken them, I can simply let the criminals do it for me."
 damota.0171.a:0 "Patrol the roads."
 damota.0171.b:0 "Take their offer."
 damota.0171.c:0 "Let the thieves have them."
