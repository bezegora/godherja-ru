With such a defeat, even a recoverable one, I showed the people of the north that Adabyss is defeatable, and as soon as word of this defeat reached the capital, the order for my recall was issued. \n\nMy army became my jailors, marching me southwards, where I was paraded as an incompetent traitor before every city along the route, the jeering crowds hurling insults as I was marched through the grand avenues of Adabyss. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity of defamation and shaming, I was brought to the City of Golden Statues, gazing one final time upon its grand spires before reaching my fate. After a brief proclamation, in which all of the evidence of my failure is read aloud, I am brought before one of the great Golden Statues. As it raises its fist, I imagine what could have been."

Despite their vast power and seemingly-endless numbers, I have watched as my spearmen overwhelmed their strange crossbowmen, as their flying machines were brought to ruin by my [magi|E], as their terrible golems were broken by my forces. Uniformly, the expression upon the faces of those enemy troops that survived was one of shock. They did not believe themselves defeatable. And before now, many of my troops would have agreed with them. But with this victory, Adabyss has been shown to be fallible, and I have become known as the one who defeated them. \n\nSoon after this defeat, the territories conquered by these foreigners collapsed into disarray and chaos, with their leader having seemingly disappeared along with his army. Though some remnants of the brief Adabyssian rule might still remain, they will likely soon collapse without their military forces, and they will certainly not pose a threat to me or my realm. However minor their force, my name will now echo through history, and I will forever be known as the victor over Adabyss!"

In a great battle, the stories of which will surely be told forever, it walls, finally broken, were overcome by my forces, spearmen rushing into the gaps torn into the structure. Though countless lives were lost, as the mighty southerners fought with all their strength and magic, my banner was eventually raised above the by-that-point ruined fortress, by a lone spearman standing atop a pile of corpses. I have done what has never been done before, what many believed completely impossible. Not only have I defeated the Adabyssians in open battle, I have become the first northerner to annex Adabyssian soil. \n\nThe reaction from Adabyss to this slight, however, was immediate. Seemingly out of nowhere, a host the likes of which has never been seen appeared from the mysterious lands beyond the border, an army near one hundred thousand strong under the leadership of a decorated Adabyssian veteran. The swiftness with which they descended was unimaginable, and within minutes of their arrival, my forces evacuated the border fort. Now, their army marches into my realm, sworn to avenge Adabyss' dishonor, and end the lineage of the person who brought them such shame."

The unending waves of troops sent to oppose me have slowly been ground into dust, the jungles of Damota been fiiled with their corpses. In the citadel itself, an earlier scene is recreated, of my few living soldiers raising tattered banners above mountaints of corpses, the Adabyssians once more having brought us near to ruin with their power. \n\nReports from the south have already begun to arrive, telling of a land in chaos. Apparently, with their recent defeat by those once seen as no more than barbarous primitives, and the failure of their reconquest, faith in their Emperor has shattered, after which a series of coups occured in their legendary City of Golden Statues, even as revolt spread across the provinces. I have accomplished that which many would call impossible, something which, by all logic, should never have occurred. I have not merely defeated Adabyss. I have destroyed them."

The grand host they sent against us, blessed with all manner of miracles, has completely destroyed my army, our weapons barely able to touch their soldiers. Their airships have rained fire from the sky, catching the jungle alight as they carved their path through it. \n\nThough I tried for so long to escape them, I have been caught. In a desparate last stand, my personal guards raise their shields against the waves of crossbow bolts as one of my last [magi|E] readies a spell against a golem, before enemy spearmen appear out of seemingly nowhere. In a final skirmish, I watch my guards be cut down around me. I, however, am taken alive. \n\nAfter being marched back to the border fortress, I find my family, also captured, awaiting me. And as we enter Adabyss, we are marched through every town, paraded through every city, crowds hissing and hurling what I am sure are insults in tongues I do not understand. And the deeper into Adabyss we travel, the more I realize the truth. Against this majesty, this power, what hope did I have?"

All of the might of Adabyss, and they lost to those once named no more than primitives. \n\nIn the fortress, in the Nāgóm Kakezihī, is the true symbol of their failed dedication. A tattered banner, that of Adabyss, flies above a mountain of corpses, piled upon the site of their last stand, each of them dying to keep the banner raised. The enemy has been slaughtered to a man, each individual soldier having fought to the last, told that any outcome beyond defeat was unnacceptable, unimaginable. And so they died, they died in the tens of thousands, they died for the honor once taken from their ancestors, for a fortress that Adabyss had once considered nothing more than a ramshackle backwater. All of them died because of a few rulers, who each found their pride more important than the hundreds of thousands now sacrificed upon its altar."

For, after recovering from chaos, the Adabyssians returned, determined to recover their lost honor, to finally put those they deemed insolent savages in their place. \n\nAnd at that they have succeeded. Whatever miracle or misfortune caused their defeat in the past has not been repeated, and their mighty forces, instilled with an unwavering determination to avenge their previous defeats, have utterly crushed mine. As I attempted to flee their advance, I was captured, and dragged before their leader, presented as the leader of those who once defeated Adabyss. \n\nAnd then I was paraded through Adabyss, shown to all of their vast empire as proof that their defeat was an aberration, that they were still undefeatable. And in those southern lands, as I gazed upon the wonders which have been wrought, even damaged as they were from Adabyss's period of warlordism, I wondered how they had even lost in the first place.
