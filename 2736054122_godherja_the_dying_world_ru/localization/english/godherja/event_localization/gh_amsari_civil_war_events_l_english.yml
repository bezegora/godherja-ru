 opening_event_sarradon.2.t:0 "A Year of Little Consequence"
 opening_event_sarradon.2.desc:0 "Qanamsar Pejman has reigned for seventy years, Seventy one now that another Longest Night has passed and ushered in the new year. He is a good man, and a just ruler. Certainly wiser than some who have ruled in his place before, and some who could have done so in his stead - on this fact everyone in the Hiklahn can agree.\n\nIt must, however, be admitted that there may have been some serious lapses in judgement on his part.\n\nHis forefathers did not hesitate to see the line pruned of pretenders before their death. A brutal task to be sure, and not one which I envy, but history has proven it a necessity for the good of the Hiklahn. Pejman, however, is a good, and kind man. He has compassion for a world which is often so quick to punish the compassionate. For his virtue he may have doomed us to the fires of a full civil war, a horror not seen for generations.\n\nBut these are concerns for another time. Pejman slows with age, but he has lived for ninety years and is sure to live for at least few more. So for the time being, the chroniclers shall likely mark this year as another year of little consequence in the Hiklahn."

 amsari.0002.t:0 "The Hiklahn Mourns"
 amsari.0002.desc:0 "My father, Pejman, is dead. Of this I am certain. A horse messenger from the palace arrived yesterday bearing the news, but word reached the public at large less than a day later from the mouths of riverboat sailors and merchants. I am also certain that my brothers will be marshaling their forces, preparing to take the vacant throne by force. Though our father urged us all to peacefully accept only the eldest among us as our leader, I know many - most, perhaps - of my brothers have no intention of following this directive. And so I am left with a choice. Do I march? Or do I try to stay out of the war to come."

 amsari.0004.t:0 "A Prince Falls"
 amsari.0004.desc:0 "After quite a struggle, my victorious armies have brought prince [loser.GetName] to his knees, scattering his armies and storming his citadels. Now, as he is dragged before me I am presented with a dilemma: how shall the rebellious brother be dealt with?"
 amsari.0004.a:0 "Seize everything but leave him his life."
 amsari.0004.a.tt:0 "You will gain every all titles held by [loser.GetName] and their vassals"
 amsari.0004.b:0 "Seize everything and have him strangled."

 amsari.0004.c:0 "Have him strangled and just let the locals administer his territories."

 amsari.0005.t:0 "The Hiklahn Mourns"
 amsari.0005.desc:0 "A dark day for the Empire dawns. The last Prophet never envisioned the death of Pejman, and he never told us of what was to come next. But one thing I do know, war is coming. The Princes have been plotting against one another for years, this was an open secret, but everyone ignored that this day would come.\n\nNow my mind prickles with the idea of my own Empire...do I have the strengh to claim the Hiklahn as my own? Should I march against the other unworthy Princes? Or stay my blade and armies and ride out the death and destruction to come?"

 amsari.0006.desc:0 "As my armies approached the capital, a sense of elation hit me. Is this the beginning of a new Empire? Without the capital, I wouldn't be seen as a true successor to the Hiklahn without this magnificent Metropolis. Now, none may doubt my prowess and will to reunite the Empire against these other unworthy pretenders. It may take days or years but I will continue this war until there is no one who stands against me!"
 amsari.0006.a:0 "The Capital must be mine!"
 amsari.0007.t:0 "The War Goes On"
 amsari.0007.desc:0 "My inheritance is nothing if not bittersweet. Titles, land, money - and a desperate war to the death for my family's ancestral throne. Shall I continue in my predecessor's footsteps? Already my retinue has gathered at [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], to defend my person against dishonor. Or perhaps it is time to lay down my weapons and seek peace?\n\n Whatever happens now, it all falls to me."
 amsari.0007.a:0 "A heavy burden..."
 amsari.0008.t:0 "Victory at Last! Glory Everlasting!"
 amsari.0008.desc:0 "The pretenders have fallen, their citadels have been pulled down, and their ambitions dashed against the ground! The sacred lands of our forefathers, the sacrosanct duty to guide and protect the Amsari, by Right of the Sword they are both my responsibilities now. Those princes who wisely chose to refrain from taking up arms against me have again chosen wisely and now swear fealty to me as their rightful liege, though it would be wise for me to keep a close watch on their ambitions.\n\nAs I stand in the palace of my ancestors contemplating where to go from here, I can hear the wailing of women from the streets outside heralding yet another funeral. The Civil War has taken a heavy toll upon the Amsari, and it will take many years for us to recover. But we have risen from worse tragedies. There is naught that fate can inflict upon a people such as us, who have risen from abject slavery to mastery of the greatest Empire on Aeras, that we are not sure to overcome."

 amsari.0009.desc:0 "#N "The fools, in their arrogance, will take up arms against their brothers and sisters. Never shall they see a triumph, but instead an eternity of war widows and orphans. The Sacred river shall burst its banks, overflowing the land with clots of blood. Zaoran and his Sons shall turn their face from you in shame. Devils shall cavort upon the burnt earth, and foul magics will wrack your children's forms. An age of darkness will descend like a morning fog, and even the most virtuous among you will be rendered blind."#!\n-The Prophet Anaphernes\n\nYears of war, years of death and deprivation. Our homeland, the birthright granted to us by the Prophet himself and won for us by the suffering of our ancestors, it bleeds! [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName] forgive us for what we have squandered. Fifty long years this conflict has raged - an unprecedented occurrence in the Hiklahn. We have had civil wars aplenty, but nothing like this! An entire generation who have never known unity now reach middle age, and only a handful of elders yet remain who have clear memories of the time before the shattering of the Amsari people.\n\n Perhaps this is not the end of the Hiklahn. Perhaps one day another shall come to reunite our squabbling people, and bring order where there is now only chaos. But for now, the throne of the Qanamsars is naught but a thing of memory. The crown is no more."
