 cois.0001.desc:0 "[attacker.GetTitledFirstName] approaches my lands, [attacker.GetHerHis] intent clear - take Oraispol, and deliver a blow that [aversaria|E] will never forget, if it indeed lives to remember anything. The mood at court is bleak, and some are already discussing their places in a post-[attacker.GetFirstName] world.\n\nI am expected to deliver a rousing speech full of platitudes to the soldiers, lying to them that this is a fight not yet lost, before I am returned to my confinement. But is it not? And why should I care for this rotten court that has kept me captive for so many years?\n\nIf this is what rule looks like, even servitude under the barbarian may be better..."

 cois.0002.desc:0 "As the rainy night drags on, I am suddenly informed by my guards that a supplicant has arrived, seeking audience, and claiming to be the "ruler of [aversaria|E]". Almost out of hand, I am tempted to dismiss this fraud, but curiosity gets the better of me, and I beckon [aversarian_mercy_requester.GetHerHim] to present [aversarian_mercy_requester.GetHerHim]self.\n\nWhat follows is... quite the amusing tale. Apparently, this indeed is [aversarian_mercy_requester.GetTitledFirstName], and [aversarian_mercy_requester.GetSheHe] has come to seek submission in exchange for a paltry stretch of land near [aversarian_mercy_requester.GetHerHis] former crown city."

 cois.0003.desc:0 "I arrive at the court of [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] mud-splattered and hooded, barely having evaded the minions sent out to return me to Oraispol on my way here. As I am brought to [attacker.GetFirstName], [attacker.GetHerHis] guards initially laughing at my answer as to who I am, [attacker.GetSheHe] looks me up and down. After I convince [attacker.GetHerHim] that I am not a fraud, but the real [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName], a moment of silence looms - before [attacker.GetSheHe] and [attacker.GetHerHis] entire audience burst into laughter. Some of them are definitely looking at me in disguist.\n\n"Silence!", [attacker.GetFirstName] commands, and then lays out my fate. As I was nothing but a pawn in the machinations of 'my' court, I will not be punished. Naturally, my role as Autokratir ends, effective immediately - not that it was ever even real to begin with. I will be allowed to retain an estate in Palitake, though I am prohibited from involving myself in further politics."
 cois.0003.a:0 "It was all for the best."
 
 cois.0004.t:0 "The End, or a New Beginning?"
 cois.0004.desc:0 "I am brought to [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] in chains, Oraispol burning around me. My showing was brave, but for naught - the city has fallen regardless, and I am about to lose my head. When I am thrown against the conqueror's feet, [attacker.GetSheHe] looks at me, [attacker.GetHerHis] look subtly betraying... pity? A few hushed words are exchanged, and I am taken away in a carriage, surely to my demise.\n\nWeeks go by in this wretched carriage before I see the light of day again. The fresh scent of pines is distinctly unlike anything back in Etepezea. Around me, jagged mountains rise, narrowing in the distance to a tight pass. Though it is difficult see what lies beyond, I feel uncomfortable merely looking in that general direction. My family soon arrives as well.\n\nWhere am I?"
 cois.0004.a:0 "This must be the very end of Aeras!"
 
 cois.0005.t:0 "Shattered Hope"
 cois.0005.desc:0 "As my epic showdown with [attacker.GetFirstName] continues to drag on, neither is able to gain a decisive upper hand on the other. Small skirmishes are exchanged, towns are captured, but the climactic battle that the entire Shattered Coast is holding its breath for is yet to come.\n\nUntil today.\n\nAfter engaging a small Sjalvolki host in what seemed to be a sure, but unimportant victory, I have realized the gravity of my error - we are trapped in a valley, with no way to escape. And indeed, [attacker.GetFirstName] springs [attacker.GetHerHis] plan the moment I realize what is happening. As we are surrounded on all sides, the soldiers around me being butchered, I wonder - has it all been for naught? Was I truly the best [aversaria|E] could offer?"
 cois.0005.a:0 "I will die as I was born - in the dirt. But I will never be forgotten."
 
 cois.0010.t:0 "The Miracle at [battle_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]"
 cois.0010.desc:0 "Yesterday, I went to sleep as a pawn. Today, I rise as a king and a hero. What was thought utterly absurd was proven possible at [battle_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], where I entered the extraordinarily thin ranks of those that have successfully bested [attacker.GetFirstName] in battle. Most of the warlords of Etepezea have decided to throw in their bets with me, either out of genuine awe, or simple pragmatism. Whereas Oraispol was preparing for the grim realities of sack by a barbarian army for months, they now know nothing but revelry and celebration.\n\nI return to the city to flowers and prostrations thrown at my feet, my subjects - truly acting like they are mine for the first time. As I am carried back to my palace to cheering crowds, two things are certain. One, my former captors will no longer be able to keep me under lock and key, but definitely see me as a threat. Though they might set our differences aside temporarily to defeat Cenware, after that, all bets are off. Two, [attacker.GetFirstName] may be bruised, but [attacker.GetSheHe] is definitely not down. The Imperrech will be back - and they will be prepared next time. What happens next determines whether I become a legend, or if I lose it all."
 cois.0010.a:0 "We must prepare for the coming storm."
 
 cois.0011.t:0 "The Purest's Work"
 cois.0011.desc:0 "When I was but a boy, I would steal from the priests the most often. They were always the fattest and most dressed up in gold - it was then that I learned my disdain for faith, and how it is nothing but a colorful lie to keep the downtrodden in line. It was a lie that allowed me to soar as high as I did, but one that I have no use for anymore - today, it ends.\n\nI approach [aversarian_pope.GetFirstName], my face very likely betraying my intent. Before [aversarian_pope.GetSheHe] has the chance to even ask what I desire, I have my guards immediately flank [aversarian_pope.GetHerHim].\n\n"So this is how you repay us? You were nothing! Nothing but an upjumped street rat!""
 cois.0011.a:0 "I am not the Purest either, and you are a fraud!"

 cois.0011.c:0 "I cannot bring myself to harm you, but you must leave Oraispol forever."
 
 cois.0013.t:0 "The Enemy of my Enemy"
 cois.0013.desc:0 "While inviting the very Sjalvolki we are fighting against into our lands might seem unwise, the truth is that our realm is barren of fighting men. My foe has the advantage of endless hordes of warriors - something that I do not.\n\nLuckily, we've managed to feel out several minor chieftains who would be willing to part their ways with the Imperrech and fight for us, if we are to grant them land within Etepezea. Several of my liutenants have voiced opposition to this - some more fiercely than others. I should weigh the potential benefit with the political ramifications."
 cois.0013.a:0 "Open the floodgates."
 cois.0013.b:0 "On second thought, this might be a bad idea."
 
 cois.0014.t:0 "A Delayed Retribution"
 cois.0014.desc:0 "As we sent [aeschraes.GetFirstName]' pickled head across the straits south, I was aware that convincing Legio XXI to uproot and travel to Etepezea would be difficult, even in spite of the gift. For days, we waited, and it seems as if no response was forthcoming. Perhaps the envoy did not make it?\n\nJust as it seemed that the wanted aid would never come, the entirety of the Legion made landfall in south Argyra and announced their support for us! [axiaothea_legon.GetTitledFirstName] has already requested to establish a new base of operations at [new_hq.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and to begin preparations for the coming war in earnest."
 cois.0014.a:0 "At least something good came out of my predecessor."
 
 cois.0015.t:0 "An Uneasy Truce"
 cois.0015.desc:0 "The response from the Conclave is swift, a sealed letter arriving from their main temple written in [conclave_head.GetFirstName]'s own handwriting. Of course, it continues peddling the farce of [conclave_head.GetHerHis] pure intentions and absolute loyalty towards me, and that a humble servant such as [conclave_head.GetHerHim]self can only promise even more vigor in dealing with the barbarian nuisance at our gates.\n\nThough it may seem like empty words to one that does not know [conclave_head.GetFirstName] as well as I do, I can read the subtext well enough to know that the deal has been struck"
 cois.0015.a:0 "I don't like this, but it needed to be done."

 cois.0020.desc:0 "After years of indecisive skirmishes, [attacker.GetFirstName]'s armies and mine have fatefully met at [battle_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] in a battle that has sent shockwaves across the Shattered Coast and will reverberate across centuries. Despite it initially going in my foe's favor, a perceptive soldier managed to notice the ever-most subtle flaw in the enemy's plan. Despite not being able to confirm whether it is a trap or not, we plunged head first with exploiting it - and our triumph is secured.\n\n[attacker.GetFirstName]'s forces were first rocked, then demoralized, then attempted a rout, and finally, massacred. Their High King [attacker.GetHerHim]self barely managed to escape with a few bodyguards, but it makes no matter. This defeat has shattered what control [attacker.GetSheHe] had over the Imperrech, and now the Sjalvolki are united no more.\n\nA new era dawns, as the focus of my reign has shifted from mere survival, to the rebuilding of the much-damaged empire. My deeds are already enough to place me among the ranks of the greatest Aautokratirs, but my time on the throne is only just beginning."

Needless to say, [scheme_target.GetFirstName] found them to be decidedly less cheery company when they pulled their daggers on [scheme_target.GetHerHim] mid-dinner.\n\n[scheme_target.GetTitledFirstName] was a rather charismatic figure in the Conclave, and [scheme_target.GetHerHis] death will surely be a blow to their internal cohesion and popularity among the wider public.

Subtle, a secret display of wealth, fitting for the Viper of Oraispol.\n\n"So you come at last, the boy I made a king. The beggar to rule Aversaria. My prodigy," Rhesus said, a defeated smile playing across his normally resolute features. I could hardly contain myself, but the situation was dire, and if Rhesus could be brought down peacefully... even the Beggar King knew that great pain could be avoided.\n\n"It's over, Rhesus," I say as I raise the sword, two of the six men who had entered with me stepping forward, "If you surrender now, then your service will be remembered, and you'll be allowed a peaceful retirement."\n\nRhesus sighed again then stood, my men's spears raising an inch before stopping when the old theocrat knelt down.

Before the arrow is loosed I spin and duck, the air rushing out of my lungs as the barbarous shaft whizzes overhead and impacts somewhere off in the corner.\n\nOne of my men is the first to reach me, his hand reaching forward to drag me under the protection of his shield, when I spot yet another disturbance. One hand halfway hidden by his cloak, what it held was impossible to see, but I could see the outline of his fingers along the grip of the blade. On the streets as a boy we called it the Beggar's Chance, the hidden knife held in just the perfect fashion to be hidden by even the closest observer, but always ready...\n\nBefore the traitor can react, my sword is flying upward, impacting perfectly between the gap in his helmet. I can feel its wicked blade cleave the skin and flesh and then bounce off of the bone, only continuing its momentum with the force of my hand, my vision blinded by the burst of blood as the soldier rocks backward and topples down the stairs to the sounds of clattering cutlery.\n\nThe archer has the second arrow by now, my own with his crossbow only just now raising his, and I can only think of one thing to do...\n\nRhesus was surprised as I grabbed him, a thin and elegant blade falling out of his hand from where had half drawn it, and I spin him around in front of me just as the arrow slams through his chest and nestles threateningly against my own. The TWANG of the crossbow echoes through a moment after, and the archer topples and splatters against the fine stonework of the throneroom after a seconds pause.
