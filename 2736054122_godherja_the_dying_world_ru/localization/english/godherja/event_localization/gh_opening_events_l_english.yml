I know not where she learned it, but under her I trained in the Aversarian ways of magic, becoming one of true power, and further proving my half-brother unworthy. At the end of my studies, I was instructed in one of the greatest of Aversarian spells - I learned to make myself immortal, and she was a fine first sacrifice on my quest for my birthright.\n\nThen the Imperial Civil War came. Finally paid attention to by my father, I was sent to the front lines with a regiment of unworthy magi, however it was infinitely better there than back home. I reveled in the bloodshed. But then I heard the news that my father was martyred by the coward Aeschraes and the war was over. With a handful of loyal soldiers, I returned home and was greeted by my inexperienced and cowardly half-brother and I was reluctantly granted a position on the council. After hearing too many of his foolish ideas I could not take it anymore, and on one fine evening, when he was standing by the palace window, someone gave him a nudge and he would fall to his death.\n\nWith this, I gathered my loyalists and made my way north, rallying around me a sizable army. Amaghea was now divided, the children of my useless half-brother fighting amongst themselves for my throne as the slaves whom we had long kept in their place revolted and tore the realm asunder. During this time one of my half-witted nephews opened the gates to the Arnaz and let a worthless Aversarian legion in. They predictably betrayed him and took the mountain. As if the situation could not get any worse, more of my half-brother's children disappointed me by somehow losing to those northern barbarians fleeing from some mist, and here I stand till my last breath."

Is anyone more worthy to be the equal of the greatest Autokratirs?\n\nNo, for I am Tarnaz, the firstborn son of my father and noblest of my uncivilized relatives. Even if I were not the greatest, most mighty, most splendid ruler to ever exist, which I of course am, who would better rule over Amaghea? A brainless fool? A paranoid lunatic? A bloodthirsty demon? Of course not! There is no competition, but nevertheless fools resist, even while my mistresses- my close friends remind me that I am the most deserving of the throne.\n\nAfter reclaiming my birthright, I shall annihilate the Sjalvolki, who targeted us with their barbarian magics due to their jealousy of the greatest civilization the world has ever or will ever know. Some might call my methods wrong, but my mistresse- friends tell me otherwise, and it is their counsel I trust more than any others. After all, why would they lie? I wish only to shower my world with gifts, and those who are in the way… well that is not my problem, really. Yes, I imprisoned my mother, but I did so to buy gifts, and it was my callous and selfish brothers who refused to pay to alleviate her misfortune.\n\nThose around me chant my name, they tell me I am great. With their words, I know that I shall claim the throne, as I am the most deserving."

I will reunite Amaghea, and I shall make the slaves who dared to resist me so many years ago suffer. As many of our people have perished in crushing mollifying rebels or helping our Aversarian brothers against the monstrous Shavokee, I came upon a truly brilliant idea - why not train unworthy slaves into messengers of my wroth? Then, I can use them to get more slaves, more soldiers, and repeat until all the world is mine! Just like what I heard the Kravelki barbers are doing, one of the few good ideas those mangonels devose.\n\nThe realm shall be mine soon, and I will make the fools bleed for pretensioning to be my brothers, together with the aid of the glorious Aversarians stationed on Mount Arnaz - we cannot lose. It is good that they offered us their hand, but I wonder why Arnaz is not accessible anymore? Some of my councilors dared to suggest that they are planning to betray me... [GetPlayer.GetFirstName] is not stupid, however - I know who the real traitors here are! Slitting the throats of these liars was what anyone else would have done."

Avenge us! Silence them all!" They lament all at once, demanding the blood of the traitors, and I bring it to them so that the truth may be unfolded.\n\nI can hear them all lamenting about their past, crying about broken hopes and their ambitions. And I do my best to fulfill their wishes and not resist their will.\n\nThey have blessed me with many boons, which my mortal body sadly cannot handle, but they promise me everlasting life and godhood... They promise to me the truth."

Listen not to their lies, those fools who would tell thee that I am not born of two gods.\n\nFor I am the lost child of my late parents, Aautokratia Axiaothea and Aautokratir Aeschraes; indeed, the Purest themselves took part in a ritual of compassion to bring me into the world, for I was the only remaining hope for Aversaria. Now, you may rightly ask what proof I have of my virgin birth, and my proof is a letter penned by the deific hands of my father and mother, given to my caretaker as proof of my divine birth. All of you are free to read this sacred document, though I fear that you will have no time to do so.\n\nNow, shall you pledge your loyalty to me, or to some snivelling liar claiming to be the reincarnation of the Purest? You know that I speak nothing but the truth; after all, who but a god could have achieved such divine accomplishments? And you all flourish as a result of my rule, being kept safe by my legions. That coin you possess was given to you by my divine grace, so I shall, in the spirit of maintaining your protection, take that which I am owed. After all, I am born of the Purest to become the Purest. Who among the pure would not give a gesture of goodwill to their god?"
