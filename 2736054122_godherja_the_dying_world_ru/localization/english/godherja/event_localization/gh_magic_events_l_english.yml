 magic_decisions.1000.t:0 "A Dream of Crimson Night"
 magic_decisions.1000.desc:0 "The ritual circle for the spell was set and cast, a magick to siphon the power from the flesh and blood to bestow potency, to enhance my blood by my own power! With the anticipation, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] sent for sleep, though sleep would not come.\n\nPain was all [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] could feel - [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] called for a physician to no avail. My breath was stolen from me, as blood seeped from my mouth, my nose, my eyes! [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] could not feel my legs, nay, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] could not move any part of me. This suffering, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] felt for hours.\n\nThis cursed mortal shell is only sustained by vampirism. And though eventually [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] rose from my bed, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] must consume for blood. Truly, ne'er a break for this husk."
 magic_decisions.1000.a:0 "Eternal life, endless misery."
 
 magic.0001.t:0 "An Arcane Sacrifice"
 magic.0001.desc:0 "The flickering candles cast an ominous crimson glow across the sacrificial room as assistants run to and fro, putting the finishing touches on tonight's ritual. Intent to begin this as soon as possible, I take the ceremonial dagger and head in [main_sacrifice_victim.GetFirstName]'s direction, [main_sacrifice_victim.GetHerHis] eyes locking to mine.\n\n"
 magic.0001.desc.brave_victim:0 "Not even a hint of fear can be seen in them, however - it would seem that [main_sacrifice_victim.GetSheHe] has accepted [main_sacrifice_victim.GetHerHis] grim fate. Regardless, I may begin in earnest..."
 magic.0001.desc.neutral_victim:0 "It is obvious that [main_sacrifice_victim.GetSheHe] is terrified beyond [main_sacrifice_victim.GetHerHis] wits, but is - just barely - managing to hide it. Regardless, I may begin in earnest..."
 magic.0001.desc.craven_victim:0 ""Please, I beg you! I will do anything you want! Anything!"\n\n[main_sacrifice_victim.GetFirstName] begs for [main_sacrifice_victim.GetHerHis] life, but alas, the only use I can have from [main_sacrifice_victim.GetHerHim] is this. I may begin in earnest..."
 
 magic.0001.a:0 "Time to begin."
 magic.0001.a.sadistic:0 "Oh, I will take my sweet, sweet time with [main_sacrifice_victim.GetHerHim]."
 magic.0001.b:0 "Actually, perhaps now is not the best time."

 magic.0031.t:0 "Searching for a [magi|E]"
 magic.0031.desc:0 "I am in need of someone skilled in the arcane arts. I have already talked with my advisors about my options, and I have numerous at my disposal, depending on how much resources I'm ready to pour into this.\n\nMerely sending out word throughout my lands will doubtless find us someone, though their skill would likely be dubious. Alternatively, with some gold to entice potential recruits and spread the message further, we would be able to draw upon a bigger pool of potential recruits and vet for the best of the bunch.\n\nIf I'm truly willing to sink a kingdom's worth into this, my agents could scour the entire known world to find the true cream of the crop."
 magic.0031.a:0 "Just find whoever you can."
 magic.0031.b:0 "Investing some coin can't hurt."
 magic.0031.c:0 "Search the four corners of the world!"
 magic.0031.d:0 "I changed my mind."
 magic.0031.e:0 "I don't have the funds for this."
 
 magic.0032.t:0 "A Practitioner of the Arcane"
 magic.0032.desc:0 "A [magi|E] passing through our lands has heeded our summons and arrived at our court. Though they have indeed displayed at least rudimentary magical ability, the true extent (or lack thereof) of their powers can only become apparent with time.\n\nStill, even a mediocre [magic_tutor|E] is a marked improvement over none at all. They are likely able to cast several modest, but useful spells, and can teach children with a knack for the arcane the basics of the craft."
 magic.0032.a:0 "Better than nothing."
 
 magic.0033.t:0 "The Flavors of the Mystical"
 magic.0033.desc:0 "As I am investing a non-negligible sum into this enterprise, I have the option of instructing my agents to look for practitioners of a specific [magic_type|E], if I wish to do so. Though it will cost me slightly more, it will still pay off if I am in need of something specific.\n\nSome of the more esoteric types - namely, those rumoured to have skill in [bending_the_will_of_the_fog|E] to their ends, are still simply in too scarce a supply for us to be able to look for specifically."
 magic.0033.a:0 "Any one of them is fine." 
 magic.0033.b:0 "[living_magic|E] is the bedrock of empires."
 magic.0033.c:0 "The wielders of [dead_magic|E] soar the highest."
 magic.0033.d:0 "The fabled [wielders_of_the_fog|E]!"
 
 magic.0034.t:0 "An Adept of the Arcane"
 magic.0034.desc:0 "My search has borne fruit! After sending letters detailing our need for a skilled [magi|E] across our local region, we have come in contact with one of respectable credentials and the accolades of several former employers.\n\nWhile likely not the sort that legends are sung about, they should nevertheless prove reliable. A great deal of useful spells will become available to us, and any education that they'd provide to children with [the_gift|E] would be nothing to scoff at."
 magic.0034.a:0 "A fine addition to my entourage."
 
 magic.0035.t:0 "To the Ends of the World"
 magic.0035.desc:0 "The fortunes I am investing into this search could pay for an Aautokratir's ransom twice over. From scorched Khemet to glorious Asiupol, few will be who do not hear of my summons.\n\nThe exceptional amount of resources and skilled agents at my disposal means that I can fine-tune my search however I see fit, though it would cost even more. But at this point truly no [magic_type|E], no matter how obscure or in scant supply, is beyond my reach."
 magic.0035.a:0 "Any of them is fine." 
 magic.0035.b:0 "[living_magic|E] is the bedrock of empires."
 magic.0035.c:0 "The wielders of [dead_magic|E] soar the highest."
 magic.0035.d:0 "The fabled [wielders_of_the_fog|E]!"
 magic.0035.e:0 "Someone versed in several styles, perhaps?"
 
 magic.0036.t:0 "A Master of the Arcane"
 magic.0036.desc:0 "After months of shuffling through countless rumours, voyages to strange and distant shores, inquiries everywhere from the seediest tavern to the most resplendent royal court, we have finally found someone well worth the fortune invested. Their skills are truly exceptional, their record nigh-impeccable.\n\nWe have gained a very, very powerful asset - we should see that it does not go to waste."
 magic.0036.a:0 "Excellent!"

 magic.1001.t:0 "An Arcane Poison"
 magic.1001.desc:0 "As I go about my daily duties, I am struck by a sudden burning sensation, a feeling best described as my very blood turning to acid. I fall to the floor, writhing in pain, my servants rushing to my aid. After being dragged to my bedchamber and given a numbing concoction by my physician, it is quickly determined that I was very likely the victim of a [magical|E] attack.\n\nThough difficult to accurately pinpoint the source, I have no doubt that it is [caster.GetFirstName] behind this!"
 magic.1001.a:0 "That vile schemer!"
 magic.1002.t:0 "A Venomous Blowback"
 magic.1002.desc:0 "As the last of the reagents are placed in the ritual hall, I intone the incantations of the spell while my acolytes chant around me. The brazier in the middle of the ritual hall glows brightly, almost like the sun itself, as I pour the poison into it and place the venomous viper in its flames.\n\n[magic|E] flows into the hall at the crescendo of the spell, almost tangible enough to see with one's own eyes, the words of power directing it into the brazier. The fire's smoke turns red and poisonous, and too late do I notice that the [magical|E] energies do not dissipate as they should.\n\nIn a single moment, the smoke reaches out and consumes me, and I feel the poison ravage my body. Though one of the acolytes is able to force some healing reagents into my mouth, all I can do is scream."
 magic.1002.a:0 "Damnation!"
 
 magic.1012.t:0 "A Fiery Blowback"
 magic.1012.desc:0 "Soldiers carry to the ritual site a box of twigs, placing them next to the brazier. Dismissing them with a gesture, I place the bundle into the flames and speak a word of power. [magic|E] swells at the ritual site as the flames grow brighter and brighter, the fire obeying my every word and gesture. At the culmination of the ritual, I command the flames go forth and destroy my foes, and yet it does not respond, and instead grows greater and greater. In but a single moment, the brazier explodes in a great conflagration, throwing me to the ground and bringing devastation and disorder to my army."
 magic.1012.a:0 "Put out the fires!"
 
 magic.1101.t:0 "Exhaustion"
 magic.1101.desc:0 "Everything feels like a great labor to me. No matter how much I sleep, how much food I eat, I always feel like I am on the verge of collapse, as if I have just finished sprinting up a mountain. To stand up and walk is difficult, while running is beyond me entirely.\n\nBy the end of the day, it requires the last of my strength to climb into bed. In this state, it will be difficult to rule, but I will handle it. What more can [magic|E] take from me than capability?"
 magic.1101.a:0 "I must carry on."
 magic.1101.a.diligent:0 "No! I cannot turn into a lazy do-nothing!"
 magic.1101.a.lazy:0 "I could use a good nap anyway."
 magic.1102.t:0 "Sensitivity"
 magic.1102.desc:0 "The brush of air on my skin feels like a hand rubbing across me. As I walk, I feel every detail of the floor, each grain of wood distinct. The touch of my clothing upon me is distracting as I constantly adjust it, trying to get used to the discomfort. I can taste every droplet of wine on my tongue, and yet any minor injury is agonizing. Heat is scalding, and cold is freezing. Overuse of [magic|E] has cursed me to feel everything, for better or for worse."
 magic.1102.a:0 "I will have to get used to it."
 magic.1102.a.diligent:0 "No time to rest anyway."
 magic.1102.a.lazy:0 "How is one supposed to sleep like this!?"
 magic.1103.t:0 "In My Head"
 magic.1103.desc:0 "I can hear them. What first started as near-silent whispers, infrequent enough that I could dismiss them as rogue thoughts, has changed into a cacophony of voices, each shouting over the other, crying out for me to notice them, to listen to them. Be it day or night, they speak, telling me of what rewards await me, telling me what I should do. I fear to tell anyone, for I will likely be dismissed as insane, and then left alone to the voices. One of them informs me that my [magic|E] did this in a terrible screech, and I have no choice but to believe it."
 magic.1103.a:0 "Silence is now beyond me."
 magic.1103.a.lunatic:0 "They really do speak great wisdom!"
 magic.1103.a.craven:0 "I - I cannot take this anymore!"
 magic.1103.a.brave:0 "Eh. I'll get used to it."
 magic.1104.t:0 "Marked"
 magic.1104.desc:0 "As I have performed more and more rituals, my body has become progressively covered with tattoos, carved into my flesh in a series of attempts to strengthen my power. By now, it has become visibly distinctive, markings running from my head to my legs. Though this seems to be worth it for now, my appearance will forever be characterized by these symbols, and they will likely feature in every depiction of me."
 magic.1104.a:0 "Such is the cost of power."
 magic.1105.t:0 "Opened Eyes"
 magic.1105.desc:0 "They began as vague shapes, only seen in the dark corners of my vision, but now these... apparitions, phantasms of the mind - they have grown bold. With each [magical|E] ritual I perform, they grow harder to distinguish from reality. Most are merely peculiar, or so mundane as to escape notice, but others are rather disturbing, and I have become especially troubled during night time, when they seem to be the most active."
 magic.1105.a:0 "I shall never see clearly again."
 magic.1105.a.lunatic:0 "My eyes... they are OPEN!"
 magic.1105.a.craven:0 "I - I cannot take this anymore!"
 magic.1105.a.brave:0 "Eh. I'll get used to it."
 magic.1106.t:0 "A Red Glow"
 magic.1106.desc:0 "As I awake from my slumber, it feels like something has changed, the darkness of the night appearing slightly brighter as I glance around my chambers. Standing up, I enter the hallway, passing a servant carrying a bucket. After noticing me, he jumps, seeming shocked, and water spills onto the floor. Before I can chastise him, I see a red light faintly reflecting in the puddle, my features shrouded in its dim glow. It seems my overuse of [magic|E] has become visible in my eyes, now shining red, as if I am caught in a ritual."
 magic.1106.a:0 "My gaze will show my strength."
 magic.1107.t:0 "Pale Reflection"
 magic.1107.desc:0 "At first it seems minor, merely a trick of the light, my skin appearing paler than usual. As it continues, I become concerned that it is the sign of some illness, however my physician cannot identify the disease. Despite this, my skin now nears on white, whatever coloration I once had drained from it. This is likely due to magic, and as far as I know cannot be reversed, so the cost of my power will forever be on display."
 magic.1107.a:0 "I can live with it."
 magic.1108.t:0 "Shining Blood"
 magic.1108.desc:0 "Over the last few weeks, I have been kept awake by the feeling that something is wrong, and yet am unable to figure out precisely what. It isn't until I am woken in the early morning by a distant noise that I realize what has changed. My body appears to faintly shine in darkness, as if my veins are filled with light. Though few have commented thus far, some have given me strange looks as they pass me in the night. This has likely been caused by my copious usage of magic, and will mark me out forever."
 magic.1108.a:0 "It doesn’t seem too obvious."
 
 dream_theft.1000.t:0 "Theft of Thought"
 dream_theft.1000.d:0 "I entered in through the Dream, drifting between thoughts and memories. Wistfully gliding through the Dreams, I land on a particular one. I've found an artifact of some sorts! I began to slowly conjure the artifact into reality. I rose in the morning to see this artifact at the foot of my bed."
 dream_theft.1000.a:0 "Pleasant Dreams!"
 
 magic_decisions.2000.t:0 "Comfortable in my Own Skin"
 magic_decisions.2000.d:0 "I prepare the final steps of the ritual, double-checking to make sure everything is in place. This required plenty of blood, sweat, and tears (in some cases literally) to master, but the results will be well worth it.\n\nThe ritual begins, and I feel an aching feeling in my joints. No, not aching... pain. Scraping, breaking, popping, I feel every excruciating detail as my very bones shift beneath my flesh. But I do not cry out; I didn't become such a good mage by letting my body win out over my mind.\n\nAt last, the spell reaches its apex. My skeleton feels like it is on fire, but just as fire burns away rot, I feel the pain burning away my deformities, my inferiorities.\n\nIn one final moment of focus, I try to concentrate and imagine who to reshape myself further. I shall not be just whole, I shall be #EMP better!#. I shall be..."
