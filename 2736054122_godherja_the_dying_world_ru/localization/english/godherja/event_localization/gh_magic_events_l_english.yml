 magic_decisions.1000.desc:0 "The ritual circle for the spell was set and cast, a magick to siphon the power from the flesh and blood to bestow potency, to enhance my blood by my own power! With the anticipation, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] sent for sleep, though sleep would not come.\n\nPain was all [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] could feel - [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] called for a physician to no avail. My breath was stolen from me, as blood seeped from my mouth, my nose, my eyes! [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] could not feel my legs, nay, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] could not move any part of me. This suffering, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] felt for hours.\n\nThis cursed mortal shell is only sustained by vampirism. And though eventually [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] rose from my bed, [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetFirstThirdPerson')] must consume for blood. Truly, ne'er a break for this husk."

 magic_decisions.1005.desc:0 "This last night has proven most trialsome, and it seems that my body has become increasingly feeble. Were it not for the life force of others, I would’ve almost certainly perished. Of course, this is no issue, no issue at all indeed. As long as I am able to procure a steady supply of sacrifices, I can continue on in this world just a bit longer. This vessel cracks, but it is not yet shattered. I do, however, find myself becoming more and more in need of arcane power to ease the withering of my flesh. No longer do I bleed as mortal men do, instead leaking magical energies from each wound on my body. My heart is stilled, and the flesh is as cold to the touch as that of the dead. And yet, I live."

 magic_decisions.1006.desc:0 "A harsh night, one in which I nearly passed from the realm of the living and from which I only barely managed to pull myself from the brink with all the magical power I could muster. This has left me… changed. A gaunt, sickly looking figure now stands in my place, skin hanging loosely off my bones. To make matters worse, the situation has become dire, and each day I face the risk of falling into a sleep that I will never wake from. Death has me in its grasp, and this vessel hungers for its embrace. I am now bereft of the vitality of others, lacking the power to wrench myself free of its cold hands, and if I wish to live much longer, I must find more sacrifices, no matter the cost."

Alternatively, with some gold to entice potential recruits and spread the message further, we would be able to draw upon a bigger pool of potential recruits and vet for the best of the bunch.\n\nIf I'm truly willing to sink a kingdom's worth into this, my agents could scour the entire known world to find the true cream of the crop."

The fire's smoke turns red and poisonous, and too late do I notice that the [magical|E] energies do not dissipate as they should.\n\nIn a single moment, the smoke reaches out and consumes me, and I feel the poison ravage my body. Though one of the acolytes is able to force some healing reagents into my mouth, all I can do is scream."

At the culmination of the ritual, I command the flames go forth and destroy my foes, and yet it does not respond, and instead grows greater and greater.

Muttering something in annoyance, I reach to pick it up, but, to my surprise, my hand stops halfway. I then notice a sensation of... solidification? I try to move my arm, but the feeling rapidly spreads across my forearm. It feels as if the blood in my arm has been suffused with stone! I collapse onto my desk, my arm remaining in place. Before losing consciousness, I see a guard rushing to my side, calling for help. \n\nI wake up in my chamber sometime later. Instinctively, I try to rub my eyes, but only feel my left arm.

As my helmet starts pressing on my skull, I lose consciousness and wake up in my bed.

 magic.1022.desc:0 "The ritual circle glows a sickly green color with arcane energy as I begin to speak the necessary words, my hands inundating the room with magical power. I spread a small amount of Aervalrian dust mixed with the grinded bones of a great serpentine creature throughout the circle. Lastly, I add in a large quantity of quicksand to the mixture, but as I prepare to finish the ritual with a last surge of power, my legs suddenly give way and I collapse to the ground. I can feel every bone within my arms shatter as they are contorted by my own magic, splinters violently jutting through the flesh.

A gigantic ball of fire, terrifyingly hurtling towards my domain as I can only stare in shock at its impending descent. As the tremendous fireball collides with the earth, my mouth gapes wide at the extent of the destruction, with a massive cloud of dust forming at the site of impact.

I place down a shard of Aervalr into the ritual, and a mixture of the crushed bones of a cockatrice alongside fragments of iron, nickel and stone. Following this, I and my acolytes begin effusing immense amounts of magical energy, and the entirety of the area around us takes on the same greenish glow as our eyes. Without warning however, one of the acolytes abruptly slumps to the floor, drained of energy. Though a servant swiftly rushes out to help the acolyte to his bed, the rest of us strain in our attempt to guide the celestial body’s path, but we are soon exhausted of power as well and the ritual spirals out of control. \n\nA servant promptly starts screaming in terror at the massive object headed directly our way, and I look up in resignation tinged with fear. I stand up on shaking legs and immediately go about performing a spell of some sort to produce an arcane shield, in the hope that it will save me from certain death. I have only seconds to contemplate my life before it hits."

 magic.1028.desc:0 "Glowing tattoos seem to slither and snake across my body as the ritual roars with dark power. Acolytes rush to and fro, hastily dropping in the heart of a stone golem which prompts an explosion of magical energies that morph into tendrils of sickly green light. They rise into the sky, reaching ever higher into the cosmos as if they mean to pull down the gods themselves. An enormous fireball, resembling a falling star descends from the heavens to strike at the object of my rage. The tendrils fade away as the ritual is concluded, and I watch intently as it violently slams into the earth with a resounding boom that shakes the ground below me with its intensity. Smoke and ash arise from the point of impact shortly after, and it looks as if nothing could’ve survived that dreadful collision. This area shall not soon recover."

I soon find, to my horror and consternation, that there is no safe ground to retreat to. It almost seems as if some great subterranean demon is rending the earth itself in a rage, as I hold on to a piece of rubble with great desperation. Before long the ground ceases its shuddering, and the court Magi pulls me aside before informing me that this was done by [caster.GetFirstName]."

Despite using what we believed to be the right amount of rock giant bones along with Aervalrian shards, it seems that things are falling out of our control. No matter how much energy we pour into the ritual, the circle refuses to stabilize, and what’s more, our efforts seem to only contribute to the further destabilization of the ritual. Hastily signalling for my acolytes to cut off the flow of energy into the ritual, I unexpectedly feel the ground tremble and convulse as I all at once shout for my acolytes to run for a safe place while myself fleeing to somewhere with more stable footing. The tremors continue to increase in intensity and the feeling that this day might be my last starts to sink in."

I speak the final words of the invocation in the deep, booming tones of the earth and drawing upon my own reserves of power, force open a pathway to my destination, directing the oncoming outpouring of abyssal wrath to my chosen target. The land itself splits open as its ire rushes forth impossibly fast, and I see in the distance buildings swallowed whole, while others collapse inwards upon themselves, and small specks fleeing in terror, though for most it is an act of absolute futility.

I instruct some of my acolytes to feed in the ritual materials as necessary with the utmost of care as my eyes burn green, but I then notice that not all is as it should be. The arcane power contained within the ritual begins to grow wild and restless instead of subdued and calm as it should be, and I am unable to bring it to heel. I and my acolytes struggle fiercely to regain control of the ritual, but the situation continues to deteriorate at a rapid pace as we begin to panic.

When I slumber, Aervalr is all there is, all that matters, all that will ever be. Those around me say that my obsession with Aervalr has consumed me, that it is unbecoming of one such as I to act in such a way. They are mistaken, they are blind, they cannot see that which I see. If only I could reach out and grasp it!"

This required plenty of blood, sweat, and tears (in some cases literally) to master, but the results will be well worth it.\n\nThe ritual begins, and I feel an aching feeling in my joints. No, not aching... pain. Scraping, breaking, popping, I feel every excruciating detail as my very bones shift beneath my flesh. But I do not cry out; I didn't become such a good mage by letting my body win out over my mind.\n\nAt last, the spell reaches its apex. My skeleton feels like it is on fire, but just as fire burns away rot, I feel the pain burning away my deformities, my inferiorities.\n\nIn one final moment of focus, I try to concentrate and imagine who to reshape myself further. I shall not be just whole, I shall be #EMP better!#. I shall be..."

My eyes glow green with power as I continue to feed energy into the ritual. The stones, and a few pieces of bone along with the fragment of blood crystal to serve as the golem’s heart begin to take on a faint greenish glow themselves, prompting me to set about shaping the construct as I wish. But before I can do that, I must first conjure an image within my mind of what I wish to craft."

 magic.2250.desc:0 "I plan to engage in the vaunted Dead Magi practice of reading Aervalr in order to divine the future, so that I may be better prepared for what is to come in the future ahead. Though this form of divination is often derided for its weakness compared to various other methods, it can still prove useful for those skilled at interpreting the movements of Aervalr. Although, before one can start to read Aervalr, they must first know what they are looking for. What is it that I desire?"
 magic.2250.a:0 "I want to win great victories over my foes on the field of battle!"

My plans were thrown into disarray for the sake of mere conjecture, and I must now revise them as a result."

 magic.2300.desc:0 "I can sense the night of the full moon drawing near, a time when the Magi of the Moon are at the height of their power in all respects. Unlike the feeble and oft inaccurate moon reading that Dead Magi can practice on nights when the moon is not full, direct communion with Aervalr is among the most reliable forms of divination possible through magic. Though all Dead Magi constantly hear Aervalr whispering to them and at rare times even screaming for reasons unknown, on these auspicious nights they are able to focus the whispers into questionably comprehensible speech that often speaks of events either yet to pass or that occurred long ago. With luck, and mastery of the arcane, one can use this to accurately predict that which has not yet come. Those less capable may be broken by the immense burden of knowledge not meant for mortal minds. With that in mind, what do I wish Aervalr to guide me towards?"
 magic.2300.a:0 "Towards the most brilliant of victories in battle over my enemies."
