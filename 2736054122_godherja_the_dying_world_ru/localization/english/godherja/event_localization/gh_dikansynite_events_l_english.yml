 dikansynite.0001.t:0 "Seeking Assistance"
 dikansynite.0001.desc:0 "Our Order governs a myriad of peoples, the natives of Sarradon being slowly taught to live under the laws of Saint Dikaynos. And though it is traditional to exclusively entrust this task to the educated and anointed of our Order, it might be useful to instead seek out local assitance. After all, the Wardenites are a people with a long tradition of laws, and though their versions are often twisted, it is nonetheless helpful to attain an advisor from among them.\n\nThe Kateigorúnoi to Ketigoménon, in fact, have a list of notable jurists whom we might be able to recruit, and it would be a simple matter to request their aid in making contact. In addition, it would likely boost our standing with the often unruly local populace."
 dikansynite.0001.a:0 "Send a messenger."
 
 dikansynite.0002.t:0 "From a People of Law"
 dikansynite.0002.desc:0 "I have been sent on a mission by the Order, my task being to make contact with a Sarradonian jurist, and convince them to work with us. The Defenders of the Accused, as is their purview, have provided me with details regarding the individual I am to seek out, and so, clad in my uniform, I approach the library where they are reported to spend much of their time.\n\nAs I walk through the streets, I am surrounded by lowered eyes, the average pedestrian making a deliberate effort to avert their gaze when I pass them. Eventually I reach my destination, where I find the jurist hunched over a desk, studying a text. Getting [sarradonian_jurist.GetHerHis] attention, I explain the opportunity they are presented with. After some skeptical pondering, they agree, and walk beside me. Seeing a reputable member of the local community, the people on the streets seem much less fearful on my return trip."
 dikansynite.0002.a:0 "A job well done."
 
 dikansynite.0003.t:0 "A New Advisor"
 dikansynite.0003.desc:0 "The Kateigorúnoi to Ketigoménon have returned to me, accompanied by a clearly educated local. They introduce themselves as [sarradonian_jurist.GetFirstName], and proceed to explain their credentials and local popularity.\n\nWithin a few days, the pile of paperwork on my desk has suddenly lightened, save for a handful of reports, describing increased compliance in one of the many cities under the Order's watchful eye."
 dikansynite.0003.a:0 "A good decision."
 
 dikansynite.0011.t:0 "Loosening the Grip"
 dikansynite.0011.desc:0 "Though many of those who defy the Saint's Law are killed on the spot, there are also a large number that are instead sent to prison, to serve out a sentence as proscribed by the magistrate on the case. These centers of incarceration stand to the native Sarradonians as embodiments of the Order's brutal justice, and are often the target of anarchic attempts to free their inhabitants. Though it would obviously violate the law to spring them from prison, lightening the sentences of many of them is completely within legal boundaries, and would be an expedient way to curry favor with the populace. \n\nThe Kateigorúnoi to Ketigoménon, in fact, have a sizable list of prisoners who they believe are deserving of less harsh punishments, and would likely be glad to send one of their own to review the situation at one of our prisons. Though some local chaos could be expected, the people under our rule will appreciate such a show of benevolence."
 dikansynite.0011.a:0 "Get a Defender to review them."
 
 dikansynite.0012.t:0 "Unlocking Chains"
 dikansynite.0012.desc:0 "Requested for a mission to set free prisoners, I traveled to a dungeon within the Order's domains. When I arrived at the prison, a squat grey-brick building, I was immediately struck by just how dour the place seemed, with even gazing upon it stirring a feeling of sadness within me. Upon entering, I was greeted by a knight of the Order, who demanded my reasons for being there. I explained to him that I had come to review the sentences of many prisoners, and though he laughed, he stepped aside, gesturing to a thick-looking wooden door, the one speck of color on a grey wall. \n\nBeyond him, I entered a thin hallway, the stench of unwashed bodies and excrement assailing my nostrils. As I walked down, gazing into the cells, I saw emanciated prisoners clad in rags, each begging to be set free. They were sorted by the severity of their crimes, with the worst offenders being packed into ever-tighter cells. Turning back, I approached the knight once more, and requested the paperwork keeping track of the prisoners. Looking at them and the crimes they were accused of, I could easily split them into 3 categories. Those who were very clearly political prisoners, those who had witnesses vouching for them, and those who nobody can back up. The questions are, who do I release, and can I convince the guards to let me do so?"
 dikansynite.0012.a:0 "Only the obviously wronged."
 dikansynite.0012.b:0 "All who others will vouch for."
 dikansynite.0012.c:0 "Everyone must be set free."
 
 dikansynite.0013.t:0 "A Loosened Hand"
 dikansynite.0013.desc:0 "I have been informed that those who were most obviously wronged by corruption within the judicial system have been set free, to the acclaim of the locals. Supposedly, word of newfound benevolence has already begun to spread, and across the territories I control, I am praised, as is the Defender who directly undertook the mission.\n\nThrough these actions, I have shown myself to be a friend of the people, or at least willing to work with them, though I cannot ride this move forever."
 dikansynite.0013.a:0 "They cheer for now, at least."
 
 dikansynite.0014.t:0 "A Loosened Hand"
 dikansynite.0014.desc:0 "I have been informed that those who were able to find a witness to vouch for them have been set free, to the acclaim of the locals. Supposedly, word of newfound benevolence has already begun to spread, and across the territories I control, I am praised, as is the Defender who directly undertook the mission.\n\nThrough these actions, I have shown myself to be a friend of the people, or at least willing to work with them, though I cannot ride this move forever."
 dikansynite.0014.a:0 "They cheer for now, at least."
 
 dikansynite.0015.t:0 "A Loosened Hand"
 dikansynite.0015.desc:0 "I have been informed that all those within the individual prison have been set free due to potential corruption within their trials, to the acclaim of the locals. Supposedly, word of newfound benevolence has already begun to spread, and across the territories I control, I am praised, as is the Defender who directly undertook the mission.\n\nThrough these actions, I have shown myself to be a friend of the people, or at least willing to work with them, though I cannot ride this move forever."
