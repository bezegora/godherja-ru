 marcher_political.0001.desc:0 "As my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('previous_chevalie_ruler'))]'s lifeless body is burned away by the pyre, my mind is heavy with worries. It is no secret that many in Chevalie have been waiting with sheathed daggers for this moment, for every time a [previous_chevalie_ruler.GetTitleTierName] passes, opportunities are ripe for snakes to seize power.\n\nAlready, whispers are pouring in of plotting nobles and their pet pretenders making plans for rebellion out in the countryside. My court is unusually empty as well, as many have fled to their estates to prepare for the coming civil war.\n\nIn the coming days, rebels will appear like toadstools. I should begin mustering my armies and preparing for the inevitable."

 marcher_political.0003.desc:0 "[SCOPE.sC('previous_chevalie_ruler').GetTitledFullName] is dead. The time for action is now, as there are whispers in my court claiming that I am Chevalie's true king. If I am crowned, few will be able to question my right to rule."

 marcher_political.0004.desc:0 "Expectedly, not all were content to sit on their laurels and pass up the opportunity to push their claim to the throne. Word has already reached me that [first_pretender.GetFirstName] has been proclaimed [first_pretender.GetTitleTierName] in [first_pretender.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier], but [first_pretender.GetSheHe] is sure to be followed by more.\n\nThe following days are sure to prove hectic as the first battles of the coming conflict are fought. I can only hope that my newfound foes will break their heads against each other, rather than focusing on me."
