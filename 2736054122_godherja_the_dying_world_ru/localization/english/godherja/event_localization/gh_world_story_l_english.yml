 world_story.0001.t:0 "The Fall of Oraispol"
 world_story.0001.desc:0 "A ragtag group of petty nobles from the northern capital has arrived in our lands, seeking refuge and bringing grave tidings - [title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier] has fallen to the barbarian hordes of [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName]! Despite a heroic defense by the hopelessly outnumbered garrison of the city, the once proud metropolis has been laid low and left a thoroughly ransacked, burned out husk of its former self. \n\nThe development, though silently anticipated ever since the disaster at the Elysian Pass, has still sent shockwaves across the already demoralized and war-torn remnants of the Empire. With the north now seemingly permanently slipping away into a barbarian-ruled anarchy, the prospects of a general restoration of imperial order grow ever more dim and unlikely."
 world_story.0001.desc.sjalvolki:0 "Today is a great day, for an old evil has finally met its end. The brave, unstoppable warriors of our people have driven a stake through the dark, bile-filled heart of the [aversarian|E] beast that once sought to devour all - [title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier] has fallen.\n\nAs [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName] gazes down upon the vanquished city, a new age dawns. With a clear victory over the Empire now widely considered a foregone conclusion, our great march across the known world is coming to an end. For all the glory earned and rich lands taken, it is finally time to call this place our new home."
 world_story.0001.desc.iyrossi:0 "Though the wheels of justice might turn slow, they do seem to turn indeed. After a thousand years of depravity, cruelty and boundless malice, the time has come for our former masters to repay their dues.\n\n[title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier], once a city thought invulnerable, now lies broken beneath the boots of [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName]. The arrogant edifices that once stood as a monument to the [aversarians|E]' blind hubris are now nothing more than burning piles of rubble.\n\nThe long years of our captivity are finally coming to an end. We must seize the moment and throw off the last vestiges of the foreigner's yoke now, for a new, brighter future awaits our people."
 world_story.0001.desc.generic:0 "What initially seemed to be the exaggerated tavern gossip of passing mercenaries and merchants has now been confirmed by a herald from the court of [oraispol_conqueror.GetTitledFirstName] - [title_c_halium.GetNameNoTier] has fallen.\n\nThough the great city had been undergoing a general decline with the ongoing disintegration of the Empire, the symbolic power of the event is still undeniable. All across the Shattered Coast, the news has been met with utterly predictable horror by [aversarians|E] of all stripes, while their enemies have erupted into jubilant revelry. Though no doubt an event of enormous historical magnitude, however, we ultimately hold little stakes in that particular race."

 world_story.0100.t:0 "The Gates of Oraispol"
 world_story.0100.desc:0 "This is it. This is the culmination of my life's work, my finest hour, the greatest joy I shall ever feel.\n\nI was born as no one. My place of birth was a village out in the most backwater of colonies, long since consumed by the [fog|E]. Battle by battle, corpse by corpse, I have clawed my way from the very edges of the world to its beating, gilded heart, and come to claim it for myself.\n\nAs I make my way towards the Column of the Purest, the euphoric crowds lining the streets shout my name, their jubilant screams almost a deafening cacophony.\n\n'Savior! Black Sun! Autokratir! Purest!'"

 world_story.0101.t:0 "Bastonport"
 world_story.0101.desc:0 "We are getting closer to our ultimate goal. Not even a few years ago, all I had was a single, weakened legion under my command, and a few worthless tracts of land in the extreme north of [aversaria|E].\n\nToday, I hold one of the Empire's most bountiful cities, and its surrounding countryside. The road here was not easy - for every meadow, every forest, every farmhouse, enough blood was spilled to feed a river. Kalithipsomi used to be a feral, barbarian-controlled anarchy, but now I have finally brought order to the troubled province. My deeds are great enough that, if I wish, I can rename the city in my honor, and it would not be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut Bastonport, rich as it is, is not what I desire. And I turn my eyes south, my life's desire tantalizingly close..."

 world_story.0150.t:0 "The Storming of Tchouran"
 world_story.0150.desc:0 "Ships filled to the brim with treasure have unexpectedly begun flowing into ports across [chevalie|E], arriving from the distant lands of the Amsari in [sarradon|E]. Apparently, the capital of the exotic empire has fallen to our mercenaries and adventurers, who proceeded to cart off anything even remotely valuable from the city - though apparently, even with a complete lack of restraint they're finding it difficult to completely strip it of its gold.\n\nThe exotic wares of the southerners have become something of an overnight sensation among the highborn, with the loot so abundant that golden jewelry has been selling for the price of a flask of mead in places, and several goldsmith guilds in Peti Gisredde are demanding that the influx be contained, lest they be run out of business.\n\nAnd yet, the greed of the Western Royal Trading Company has not been sated. Their agents scour the land for recruits, and understandably so - many within their ranks have chosen to retire, now in possession of so much wealth that it would take ten extravagant lifetimes to spend."
 world_story.0150.desc.amsari:0 "It would seem that the misfortunes of the ongoing civil war have found a way to sink us even lower than we had thought possible - Tchouran, the holy capital of the Qanamsars, a city that has never fallen to a foreign host in its entire long history, has succumbed to a siege by barbarian mercenaries and thieves!\n\nChevalien vultures have taken advantage of the current chaos to storm one of the proudest bastions of our people, and we can do naught but listen to the horrific tales spread by refugees from the metropole. Several quarters have been set alight, countless innocents slain, temples left desecrated, and the Khanhe Peashmbra has reportedly been so thoroughly looted that only its naked marble walls still remain.\n\nWarlords across the former Hiklahn have vowed to avenge this catastrophe and expel the northern scum as soon as possible, though any hope for a coordinated military action is as remote as Zaoran himself coming to our rescue."
 world_story.0150.desc.generic:0 "News from the ongoing civil war raging in the lands of the Amsari indicates that the conflict has taken an unexpected turn. The chaos has proved fertile ground for the Marchers, who have somewhat indirectly been profiting off the political situation for a time, though their aims now seem to be much greater - they have captured Tchouran, capital of the Hiklahn and one of the most resplendent cities of the world.\n\nExactly how this came to pass is not entirely clear - the warlords of the region have been slinging increasingly far-fetched accusations at each other, though most are likely also cursing the late Pejman in private, for it is he who so generously provided the Chevalien with their foothold in the region decades prior despite advice to the contrary.\n\nWhatever the case, this is undoubtedly a turning point in the conflict. The northerners, previously mostly ignored, have now drawn the intent attention of the locals, while the taste of the riches seized within Tchouran seems to have only emboldened the invaders' own ambitions."

 world_story.1001.desc:0 "Hello! Thank you for playing Godherja: The Dying World, and its first update in nearly a year! This took a lot of sweat, tears, and sacrifices to dead gods to get released and we are so happy to finally have it out there. Of course it has been a very long time since we have had a wide release, and this is a *massive* patch, so please understand it isn't entirely polished yet!\n\nWe will be putting out a development retrospective talking about the difficulties we had in getting this patch together, as well as discussing the changes we've made to our development methods and team structure to ensure that future patches do not take anywhere near this long. Please go onto our Discord to report any bugs you find in the meanwhile, and keep in mind that the map was sadly not finished its repainting when we decided to release - it'll be done soon!\n\nThe next Godherja patch will be for Royal Court. We upload all released versions of the mod to ModDB in case you wish to access older versions, and Steam allows you to roll back the game version if the mod becomes incompatible.\n\nThank you again for playing! We hope you enjoy the wonders of the south :)\n\n~ThePinkPanzer and the development team."
