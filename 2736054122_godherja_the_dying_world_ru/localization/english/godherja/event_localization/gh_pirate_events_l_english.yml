 gh_pirate.0002.desc:0 "With the passing of [previous_holder.GetName] I am now left in control of [previous_holder.GetHerHis] band of raiders, thieves and brigands as well as a sizeable fleet of galleys with which to pillage the seas. Of course, given the somewhat ad hoc nature of our little assembly, I can hardly count on their allegiance to come from any sense of lawful rule or deference to authority. No, here we follow only the strong and if I am to ensure my realm does not break apart, I must demonstrate that strength.\n\n#NIf you do not have at least 15 martial and level 3 fame in 5 years, your realm will shatter via your vassals becoming independent, though you will also gain claims on their lands if you should wish to seek revenge. You will receive another warning reminding you of this in four years.#!"

 gh_pirate.0003.t:0 "Deadly Currents Beneath the Surface"
 gh_pirate.0003.desc:0 "Though several years have passed since the death of [previous_holder.GetName], my vassals have yet to fully accept my command. Every day another act of insubordination threatens to dissolve the already fragile bonds holding together this merry little band of thieves and pirates. Already the strongest of my vassals are likely beginning to maneuver to set themselves up as fully independent captains, and should I continue to fail to show strength they are likely to follow through on their plans. If nothing changes, the lifespan of my captaincy can be measured in months, not years.\n\n#N If you do not have at least 15 martial and level 3 fame in 1 year, your realm with shatter via your vassals becoming independent, though you will also gain claims on their lands if you should wish to seek revenge. This is your final warning#!"
 gh_pirate.0003.a:0 "They had better not!"
 gh_pirate.0005.t:0 "An Admirable Admiral"
 gh_pirate.0005.desc:0 "Many anxious years have passed since the death of [previous_holder.GetName], but at long last I am starting to feel secure in my power. No longer do my underlings brazenly demonstrate their insubordination, and I think I am starting to detect the barest hints of respect from them. While mutiny is obviously still not out of the question for a band of devious sea devils such as they, I should not have to worry about the entire fleet rising up and sailing away to find their own fortunes any longer.\n\n#P By attaining at least 15 martial and level 3 fame you have demonstrated your authority. While normal rebellions may still happen, your vassals will not go independent automatically.#!"
 gh_pirate.0005.a:0 "All is as it should be."
 gh_pirate.0006.t:0 "The Fleet Dissolves"
 gh_pirate.0006.desc:0 "Today I woke up without a fleet - or at least, without much of one. My personal vessels and those captains serving directly under my thumb remained loyal, but the rest of the brigands and thieves under my command opted to sail away to find their own fortunes, leaving me to fume and plot alone.\n\n #N You have failed to accrue at least 15 martial and level 3 fame, and so your vassals have left your realm, though you now have claims on their lands if you should wish to seek revenge.#!"
 gh_pirate.0006.a:0 "They haven't seen the last of me!"
 
 gh_pirate.0007.t:0 "A Change of Fate"
 gh_pirate.0007.desc:0 "With my return to more traditional ruling styles, my vassals begin to grow more calm and content. While some may still call for rebellion, at least not all still threaten out and out mutiny. For now, I can finally take a breath, and for once not worry about my command being directly challenged."

 gh_pirate.0001.t:0 "Mercy to the Robbed"
 gh_pirate.0001.desc:0 "While sailing aboard my ship, we spotted what seemed to be a small trading vessel in the distance, which turns away from us as soon as it spots us. My ship, however, is far faster than theirs, and the crew is always hungry for more loot. Raiding them will of course bring gold, but it could also be risky, as a trading vessel will likely employ guards. Of course, I could simply choose to let the ship pass, as it might not be worth the effort to pursue and assail."

 gh_pirate_decisions.0002.desc:0 "Long have me and my crew ravaged these waters, taking what we can or want from those less fortunate. But the days and weeks of raiding, not to mention the constant fear of being caught between a rock and a hard place, has softened my view of life. I've split what loot we still had to dole out to the crew, and disbanded my fleet.\n\nAlready, the people of my lands let out a sigh of relief, and I'm alongside them. It will be nice to enjoy some form of retirement, and peace."

 gh_pirate.0031.desc:0 "My depredations are without number, and my acts of villainy impossible to enumerate, and my loyal crews revel in the plunder they have gained under my command. Already my name is whispered across the far corners of Aeras. Brigand, pirate, thief - they use these words and more to describe me. But as my infamy has spread, a new word has been added to their lexicon: Pirate King.\n\n Though we treat the title like something of a joke, today my crews and I performed a mock coronation. Standing atop a crest overlooking a sheltered bay, a golden circlet captured from some princeling or another on a raid now almost forgotten was placed upon my head in sight of my fleet, anchored and arrayed before me. Perhaps not a typical crowning, but it will do."
