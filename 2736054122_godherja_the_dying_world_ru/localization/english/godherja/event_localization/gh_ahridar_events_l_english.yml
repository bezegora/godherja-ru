 ahridar.0001.desc:0 "I travel to the holy house of Ohrasik atop a sacred Ahbshaani lizard, overlooking the Aekershaan crater and its people. There, I am greeted by the priests and the rituals begin.\n\nI am anointed with the sacred oils of the many flora of the crater, tying my body and soul to this sacred land.  Eight times I chant and recite the sacred tales of Ohrasik and his war against the shadows. Eight times I beseech Ohrasik to let his will flow through me. I bring my eyes to the sun, and watch for a full burning minute, calling out to Ohrasik with all my body and soul.\n\nFinally, the Dwarsha judge me acceptable, and allow me to dawn the sacred halo of the sun. I am now Malaak, avatar of Ohrasik, and executor of his will."
 ahridar.0001.a:0 "I will see his will done"
