 wardenite_yearly.0001.desc:0 "Two major Tusuffna of [tusuffna_dispute_county.GetNameNoTier] have been increasingly at each others' throats for some time now. [ROOT.Char.Custom('TusuffnaPersonalStance')]\n\nThe leaders of the two factions have presented themselves to my court and each made their case. Though their squabble is hardly important or of great moral import, I should still carefully consider my course of action."
 wardenite_yearly.0001.a:0 "Surely some compromise can be reached?"
 wardenite_yearly.0001.b:0 "Just don't do it again, alright?"
 wardenite_yearly.0001.b.cynical:0 "These zealots are none of my concern."

 wardenite_yearly.0001.c.wrathful:0 "Stop this nonsense, NOW!"
 wardenite_yearly.0001.c:0 "Knock this off immediately, or else."
 wardenite_yearly.0001.d:0 "[tusuffna_leader_one.GetFirstName] is in the right."

 wardenite_yearly.0011.t:0 "The Perils of Temptation"
 wardenite_yearly.0011.desc:0 "It would seem that my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('decadent_child'))], [decadent_child.GetFirstName], has begun to associate with a group of Minbiri'a radicals, spearheaded by a certain [minbiria_friend.GetFirstName] that they have apparently grown quite fond of. Though the Minbiri'a is ostensibly a serious, if radical school of Wardenite jurispudence, they nevertheless hold a rightful stigma for their... unorthodox, and often hedonistic ways.\n\nIn many ways, membership within them is considered regrettable, though common amongst the youth.[ROOT.Char.Custom('WasMemberOfMinbiriaRemark')] While it would not exactly be seen as the height of piety, I could simply overlook this and let [decadent_child.GetFirstName] grow out of it."
 wardenite_yearly.0011.desc.zealous:0 "With each passing day I am more and more dismayed by the company my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('decadent_child'))], [decadent_child.GetFirstName], has begun to keep. Minbiri'a, they call themselves, but I'll call them for what they are - scoundrels, apostates and harlots!\n\nLate into the night I find [decadent_child.GetFirstName] mingling with these 'free thinkers', engaging in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]-knows what kind of heresy and debauchery. One of these lowlifes [decadent_child.GetSheHe] seems to have grown especially close to, some charlatan by the name of [minbiria_friend.GetFirstName]. [ROOT.Char.Custom('WasMemberOfMinbiriaRemarkZealous')]\n\nI must do something about this!"
 wardenite_yearly.0011.a:0 "I forbid this nonsense!"
 wardenite_yearly.0011.b:0 "It's just a phase."
 wardenite_yearly.0011.c.cynical:0 "Good, [decadent_child.GetSheHe] should keep an open mind."
 wardenite_yearly.0011.c:0 "Let the [decadent_child.Custom('GetLadLass')] have [decadent_child.GetHerHis] fun!"
 wardenite_yearly.0011.d:0 "This scum will learn to steer clear."

 wardenschools.0001.t:0 "Legal Chaos!"
 wardenschools.0001.desc:0 "My judges and I have been in heated discussion all day following the pronouncement from  my liege [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetLiege.GetName] announcing a new series of legal standards aligned with a new legal school. While this is entirely within [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetLiege.GetHerHis] right. It is also entirely within my right to refuse to ensure this is instituted in my territory."

 wardenschools.0002.desc:0 "I have just received word that my liege has, at long last, accepted the legal suggestions proposed by my particular school. This can only be a sign of good things to come."
 wardenschools.0002.a:0 "Finally!"
 wardenschools.0003.t:0 "Legal Bizareness"
 wardenschools.0003.desc:0 "I had just finished ensuring my local courts had recieved my letter when a missive from the capital arrives. My liege, in whose name I have just finished alienating half my judges, is dead. I'm frankly at a loss for words. I can't exactly take my missives back..."
 wardenschools.0003.a:0 "This Feels Like a Sign..."
 wardenschools.0003.a.tt:0 "well this is embarassing"

 tusuffna_stance_positive:0 "Though often derided as mere thugs, the Tusuffna are religious brotherhoods most often righteous in their zeal, but misguided and hamstrung by a lack of proper organization. Two such groups in the county have allowed a feud to escalate to a level of unacceptable violence, and I am expected to intervene."
 tusuffna_stance_neutral:0 "These religious brotherhoods — or more rarely, sisterhoods — lack the trappings of a proper, organized force and are more resemblant of a street gang, and are unsurprisingly often at odds with each other. However, the dispute in the county has escalated in violence to the point where my own intervention is expected."
 tusuffna_stance_negative:0 "Though the petty disputes of these zealotry-driven thugs is usually far beneath the notice of someone of my stature, the conflict in question has recently escalated to a level of violence that requires my intervention."
