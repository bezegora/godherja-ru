 fieldsofpearlsbadspelltext1:0 "The screams of the [magi|E] I assigned to take the lead and their assistants are the first indication that something has gone terribly wrong. I watch in horror as one young man breaks off from scribing a rune on the floor to begin writhing in agony. His panicked cries dwindle first into hoarse rasps, then into stony silence as I am witness to his face disintegrating into an oily, ash-like substance."
 fieldsofpearlsbadspelltext2:0 "The mid-syllable silencing of the [magi|E] taking the lead on the ritual is the first clue that something has gone wrong. Glancing up I notice that he has dissapeared, leaving in his place an acrid smelling smoke. Everyone stares in disbelief for several long seconds before, without warning, one of the assistants vanishes as well. Panic begins to set in as one apprentice after another appears to evaporate without warning, sound, or explosion."
 fieldsofpearlsbadspelltext3:0 "The sudden danger is immediately apparent, as one of the apprentices applying oils onto a canvas pauses with a pained look on his face before violently exploding a second later, showering the room in gore. We all pause for a second, fear igniting in a dozen pairs of eyes. The ritual spares us only a few seconds of calm before one of my servants who had been ferrying reagents from my storerooms gasps, then follows suit, splattering everyone in blood and chunks of flesh."
 pale_skin_black_feathers:0 "Her body is feathered with deep black iridescent plumage, and her face is shockingly pale-skinned with thin lips and eyes of deepest green."
 dark_skin_scaled:0 "Her skin is dark and her body covered in scales that seem to have the luster of opals. Despite the grave danger posed by her appearance, I have to admit she may be one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever seen."
 feathered_wimple:0 "Her body is covered with feathers of purest white, shining in the sunlight like purest alabaster. Her face is of middling complexion, wrapped in a massive silk headdress."
 fire_blast_shahmaran:0 "I am thrown to the ground as the very air itself combusts, slaying Ritualist worshipper and hunter alike without discrimination. Burned and badly wounded, my surviving hunting party drags me away from the battlefield."
 vacuum_implosion_shahmaran:0 "The very air ripples around the scattering combatants. Fighters are suddenly wrenched off their feet and into the air, violently twisting in confusion and agony. With a thunderclap the combatants too near the epicenter are split asunder into liquified gore. I am pelted by a fierce hail of bone and viscera and stone from where her spell split open the earth itself, and feel a sharp pain as what I hope is just a jagged shard of rock pierces my side."
 screaming_ghosts_shahmaran:0 "Aeras itself seems to exude a greyish fog that ripples as if it possesses a mind of its own. Parts of the mist begin to split off, taking on shapes that are almost recognizably human, apart from their claw-like appendages. With an agonized shriek they fall upon the combatants as both hunter and Ritualist attempt to flee. One comes right for me, raking its claws against my face and body. I stumble backwards and run, trying to escape before the agony of my wounds overcomes me."
