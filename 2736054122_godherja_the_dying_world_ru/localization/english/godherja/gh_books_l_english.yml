 artifact_manswelbestiarium_page_1:0 "\n\n#size:15 A preface to the reader: This work has been quite a costly thing, being distilled from countless years spent on the sea and on the road with men and women long since dead. Lucky, was I, to survive the travails which brought me face to face with the monstrosities about which you shall soon be reading. But for all the horror I also found beauty, and for all the savagery I also found love. It is to those I found and those I lost whom I dedicate this text. To those reading in hopes of finding their own beasts to slay I have naught but caution to offer. I have known too much grief stemming from overweaning bravado to council more of the same. Take my work not as encouragement, but as a warning and a solemn hope of your miraculous survival. Many were not so lucky as you to have such a guidebook at hand."

 artifact_manswelbestiarium_page_2:0 "\n\n#size:15 The ghoul is a horrendous ape, native to some regions of Sarradon. From a distance it may appear like a man, but upon closer inspection its inhumanity is apparent, with a protruding brow, batlike nose, piercing red eyes, and a body covered in coarse black fur. They have a greed for flesh, particularly that of men. When given the choice they will seek this delicacy out to the exclusion of all other fruits and meats. They possess a talent for mimickry, which they use to great advantage to lure the unwary to their doom. Curiously, in recent years with the Saint's Crusade in Sarradon some wealthy Aversarians have found it fashionable to import stocks of these beasts to keep in their menageries. They are reportedly shy and easy to handle unless given cause to believe they have the upper hand on their handler, or outnumber them."

 artifact_manswelbestiarium_page_3:0 "\n\n#size:15 The Cockatrice, known to some as a Eagle of Aervalr, to others the Granite Cockerel, and to others still the Alchemical Dragon is a God-Touched beast renowned for its venom, immense ugliness, and foul stench. Most notorious of all is its gaze, piercing and deadly. The cockatrice is known to have an intrinsic relationship with the cycles of Aervalr, and can work transformations of the dead matter of Aeras with but a glance. It is for this reason that Dead Magi use the beast as a heraldic icon. Care should be taken, for if the moon is waxing full the monstrosity is at its most potent. It has a particular fondness for transmuting bone to stone, which has the effect of instantly killing any unfortunate enough to be subjected to its gaze."

 artifact_manswelbestiarium_page_4:0 "\n\n#size:15 The werewolf is a most duplicitous of beasts, born of most foul sorcery of the blood. The Aversarians are of the opinion that the Sarradonians were responsible for their creation, and the Sarradonians are lately of the opinion that it was the Aversarians who are to blame. The brutes appear as a man during most times, but during certain hours their form will warp and change into that somewhat between man and wolf, but larger than either. They gain prodigious strength during these intervals. Those which survive the wrath of their kin to live into old age are remarked to sometimes gain control of the time and place of their changing. Nevertheless, once so altered they lose all reason, becoming immensely prone to cannibalism."

 artifact_bookseventysevencities_page_1:0 "\n\n#size:30 Oraispol#!\n\n#size:15 One would assume that the average reader would need no introduction to Oraispol, cradle of [aversaria|E] and traditional capital, but it would be prudent to remember that the sheer size of the empire means most of its denizens only know of the metropole as a distant, hazy symbol of imperial grandeur, and little else. Hence, it is only right that our journey around Aeras begins at its heart.\n\nNestled on the banks of the Halium river, the city's origins are now largely shrouded by the mists of time, its foundation stories dime and dozen and each more fantastical than the last. One of the major polei of proto-[aversaria|E], it would rise to prominence under the patronage of the almost legendary Archexir Oraisix, whose name it would come to bear for the rest of history. Though its fortunes would wax and wane in the ever-shifting tides of ancient [aversarian|E] politics, it would ultimately come to unite the rest of ancient Palitake and Imperial Isle under Dhaci'enox, the first Aautokratir, in 0 IS, and would remain the seat of the empire for the next 700 years."
 artifact_bookseventysevencities_page_2:0 "\n\n#size:15 After the [chaos_of_the_seventh_century|E], however, it would come to be displaced by its eastern counterpart, Asiupoli. Though somewhat overshadowed in size and prosperity, the city has nonetheless remained one of [aversaria|E]'s most cherished, and the site of many ancient traditions - for example, most Aautokratirs still choose to be coronated on the Nikaryins' Hill in its heart.\n\nFor a city with such a rich history, it is unsurprising that seemingly every street corner has a landmark of historical note. Most of its famous sites are clustered around the great palace complex of the Nikaryins' Hill - the Column of the Purest, the Fountain of Eternal Serenity and the Astrothrakeion, just to name the most prominent examples. The palaces themselves have been built, rebuilt and expanded upon times beyond count, with the very oldest structures dating back to Archex Eoliax'icana's rebuilding projects of the late 4th century BI in the aftermath of the Arakkariac sack of the city."
 artifact_bookseventysevencities_page_3:0 "\n\n#size:15 The spiritual center of most of Palitake also lies nearby, in the Temple of Arsodiaes - a majestic structure built amongst the incredible ruins of a palatial complex older than recorded history, and believed to have been the seat of the First Man Arsodiaes (who is also, coincidentally, considered the founder of the city in many myths).\n\nThe suburbs, however, are no less full of historical curios, though certainly more overlooked by visitors. Obviously, Maklea's Arena in the Amaria district is a major exception, being one of the most popular and famous sites of the entire city, its seemingly unceasing, bloody tournaments drawing crowds the size of a lesser city daily. The beautiful boulevards and geometrically perfect streets of Cythenion are also an object of note, the relic of a brief, but spirited attempt at rationalising the layout of the city in the late 10th century."

Perhaps you are an Aversarian yourself, wishing to learn of the brother and sister cultures you enjoy the delights and glory of our beautiful empire with. Perhaps you are of lesser blood, and call the rugged northern lands or the burning deserts your home, or perhaps you are even a literate slave reading to your rightful owner as demanded! It matters little, for whether you are a human or foreigner, you too can enjoy a glimpse into the world that the purest people's inhabits. Aversaria is a booming and prospering empire with no end to its growth in sight, and perhaps will one day encompass all corners of the world as we know it. As such, there is little excuse not to learn of her power and glory, and of the beautiful and intricate cultures that call it home!\n\nBlessed by the Purest, the First Men, and the glorious Aautokratir Aeolus (long may he reign!), I therefor dedicate this series of guides to the wondrous peoples who call our Empire home. Thank you dear reader, and I pray you find within words and images that delight you so that you may dream of the day you meet the grand people of Aversaria!"
 artifact_pocketguideaversaria_page_2:0 "\n\n#size:15 The Home of the Empire\n\nDour and imperious, the people of Etepezea have birthed more Aautokratir's than any other governance and proclaim the glorious achievement of being the founders of fair Aversaria. It was in the multitude of city states dotting the coast of the Imperial Isle and western Palitake that the Empire we love was birthed, and it was the people's of these cities who built the cultures that are contained within.\n\nEtepezeans are known for their noble demeanor. It is not the place of the west to show undue oppulance or obsess over fineries and the strength of their swords. Instead, westerners are known for showing power through power, relying on their reputation, sharpened wit and the glory of their history to speak for them. Of all of the people's in this writing (except possibly the colonials), the Etepezeans are perhaps the most subdued. Why waste time and riches showing your power, when it is so known? So steeped in tradition are the westerners that they still name their greatest champions 'Drakarstatarox', a modern bastardization of the ancient word for 'Dragon Soldiers.' Indeed, it was the Etepezeans who first tamed and rode the might and treacherous dragons, and used their might to forge what would become Aversaria.\n\nWestern architecture is old and mighty. Built upon the great ruins of the First Men, the Etepezeans mimicked their style as they built new fortresses among the scattered remains of the old. The name for this architecture has long been known as 'Aekorsdyxian' or 'proto-Aversarianesque', and incorporates sweeping arches and intricate floral designs as the ancients crafted alongside more 'modern' architecture such as the Aversarian column.."
 artifact_pocketguideaversaria_page_3:0 "\n\n#size:15 The Land of the Mountain Sun\n\nOpakhasians! What can be said of Aversaria's most peculiar of people's. The inheritors of great faith and knowledge, the people of Opakhasia are said to descend from priest-kings who ruled from the mountain peaks until they were thrown down by the superior might of Aversaria. While they did not inherit the blood of these kings, they inherited their temples, which many believe worshipped what may have been a bastardized imitation of Aversarian religion. No doubt, the barbarians who once sat in these halls looked longingly west, praying that imitation may secure themselves their own purety.\n\nOpakhasians are known for grand proclamations of loftiness. They wear ancient-like garbs over modern armor and clothes, claiming that the unending line of worship of the Purest and the right of these ancient barbarian-priests gives them rightful claim to the Empire's most faithful. An Opakhasian feast is not one to miss! For they will truly go to any expense to ensure a visitor knows of their glory. Just remember not to mention the east! The peoples of Aironoi and Opakhasia have been long rivals for many years, and you will surely enjoy more than a few choice words if you mention their eastern neighbors. But worry not! The children of Aversaria stand unified as always, and the two people's will just as often meet for well-intentioned trade or to exchange escaped slaves as they will raid and despoil the other, and the Aautokratir will always live to ensure that petty feuds to not consume mighty Aversaria.Opakhasian architecture focuses highly on showing wealth and piety. Gilded representations of the Purest and the First Men are visible in every city, and Opakhasians are known for building upon the ancient ruins of the First Men and bejewling them to enhance their beauty. While many have pointed out that many of the fine metals on their monuments are stripping or rusting, the Opakhasians I have asked are proud to tell me that they simply see this as a vestige of beauty..."

While its and peoples farms are strong, even stronger is the might of mineral wealth. The Malcoisiacs are a grim sort, but in a different manner from their ancestors in Etepezea. Malcoisiacs value simple iron and metals, and prefer to live in a sturdy fortification instead of a lavish palace. The symbol of the Malcoisiacs is the iron chain, from which they control the largest population's of slaves and servants of any governance. They even have the honor of being the only masters to have never faced a true slave revolt, something they take pride in, the northern foundries of Malcois forever supplying an endless stream of weaponry and supplies for Aversaria's glorious legions.\n\nMalcoisiacs, suiting their grim demeanor, eat simple foods and wear simple clothes. The common Malcoisiac would prefer to know they have a month's of rations to a day of feasting, but worry not! While the paternal and iron grip will never release the chain of their slaves, the Malcoisiacs are some of the kindest in Aversaria. It is only in a Malcoisiac home that you can sit safely and know that no treachery will ever befall you, for the Malcoisiacs shun intrigue and betrayal. Eat a hearty stew and tough black bread, and enjoy fine warm company among the seasoned veterans and firm merchants who call the north home. Malcois is also home to the Iyrossi.\n\nMalcoisiac architecture is stripped down and bare. Instead of monuments and temples, the Malcoisiacs prefer fortifications to ensure their slaves know the futility of daring rise against the children of the Purest. While you may not find the most comfort or beauty in a city of the valley, you are sure to find no safer..."
