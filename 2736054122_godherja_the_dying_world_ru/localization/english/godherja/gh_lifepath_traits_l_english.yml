In the nobility especially, where the courts have become increasingly esoteric in function in form year after year, the Path of Crows is seen with a high level of respect... if at an arm's distance."

As social mobility has faded from public life, many see a life with the Chapters where they can earn glory and wealth for their kin is a preferable alternative to serfdom. It helps that the followers of Nullification are nearly as legendary as those of Justice despite the Path's short age... despite the fact that, contrary to the heraldic tales, the vast majority of those who follow it will find no glory. Instead dying in one of the thousands of [lich|E] raids or incinerated by magical power. The tales only tell of those who make it, and few enough are still alive to convince anyone of their inaccuracies..."
