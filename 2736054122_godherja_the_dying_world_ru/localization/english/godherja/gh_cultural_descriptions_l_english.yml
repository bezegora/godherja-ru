 apokiakas_desc:0 "#size:15    Apokiakas, or 'Colonials' in the [aversarians|E] language, is the term given to any [aversarians|E] hailing from the northeastern colonies of Katraddia. While Katraddia was considered equal in standing to the other governances ever since the 932 IS Trelytion Dispute, it was nevertheless looked down on as a series of colonies instead of a proper province, and generally remained the most loosely held and rugged frontier of Aversaria until its destruction by the opening of [the_rift|E] and its transformation into the [foglands|E]. Descended from colonists sent primarily from Kalathipsomi due to their experience with rugged northern terrain, the Apokiakas adopted many of their qualities, preferring more mundane and practical things to decadent displays. They often went even further, northerners becoming known for mixing [aversarians|E] garb with tribal wear, worshipping a mix of [aversarian|E] and native gods, and even marrying into tribal dynasties in order to secure alliances and their borders.\n\nA hardy and proud people, they were nonetheless nearly entirely destroyed in [frodbrokna|E] and the [fog|E], what few survivors there were interspersing as refugees in the south, swearing fealty to Cenware 'Witch-Breaker' and the Sjalvolki or being led west by Nicanoneus, the Black Sun.#"
 northernimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Northern [aversarians|E] are the remnants of [aversarians|E] born north of Etepezea and west of Malcois, in the rugged colonies of Kalathipsomi.

 easternimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Eastern [aversarians|E] are [aversarians|E] born in the [aversarians|E] cities of Aironoi.

By the 10th century, most fashion in Aversaria was dictated by non-Eastern nobility playing catchup with the rapidly changing and often gaudy court dress of the east, and the nobility of Aironoi are known for regularly causing theological and cultural shocks through their displays designed to shock and make themselves the talk of Aversaria. Eastern [aversarians|E] are traditionally associated with the colors pink, purple, teal, gold and white.#"
 southernimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Southern [aversarians|E] are those [aversarians|E] native to the former cosmopolitan center of Opakhasia.

Despite this, the nobility are still known for excessive displays of wealth, Starving slaves and livestock tending near-barren fields not uncommon while traveling to one of the many feasts in gold gilded halls of the nobility.\n\nAs the government of Opakhasia is descended from the ancient 'Mountain-Sun Temple', so are the trappings of Southern [aversarians|E] culture. Southerners hold religious titles that would have been common a thousand years prior, and are known for displays of piety despite their decadence. The colors of Opakhasia are whites, golds and oranges, based off the colors of the ancient Mountain-Sun.#"
 westernimperial_desc:0 "#size:15    Western [aversarians|E] represent the [aversarians|E] native to Etepezea.

They are a rather drab and dour people, but highly regarded as the most 'regal' and 'imperious'.\n\nDespite their wealth, they are not considered as decadent as other [aversarian|E] cultures, preferring to let their riches be known through their reputation than through elaborate displays of their riches. Traditionally associated with the colors red, black and gold, Western [aversarians|E] are largely known for their skilled politicking, strong rule, powerful magics and for the heavy infantry that would eventually build the [aversarian|E] Legions. Many [aversarian|E] scholars consider Western [imperial|E] culture to be a creole of the innumerable city-states that would eventually be united into the Aautokrata, and as the modern progenitor for all other Imperial cultures.#"

Known for managing the massive slave-estates and factories of Malcois, they wear simple clothes and armor of unpainted iron, and live in homesteads that double as forts in case of slave uprisings. Central [aversarians|E] are considered an honest people, generally shunning intrigue and subterfuge as slave tactics and preferring their dealings me upfront and honest in nature.\n\nRarely known for any sort of show of wealth and power, they are still feared for their iron gripped rule, and nobles regularly carry chains of iron worn about their waist or over their shoulder, or decorating their armor, as a quiet sign to their enemies.

With the entire wider region reduced to ashes, they were able to rapidly secure favorable deals with the desperate locals and found thriving colonies across the coast.\n\nOwing to their far longer presence in the area, the Erimatos have assimilated numerous local customs and practices, markedly unlike the stubbornly zealous Agionists. Several centuries and an entire sea separating them from [aversaria|E] proper have resulted in a dialect nearly unintelligible by their continental brethren, and intermarriage with locals means that even their appearance is subtly distinct from the relatively recently arrived Makryenis.\n\nThe bloodletting of the [saints_war|E] has seen them caught in the crossfire - the Agionists tend to give them a cold, distrustful shoulder due to religious differences, while the natives treat them with outright hostility due to their perceived ties to the Saintly Orders.#"
 aeviaxian_desc:0 "#size:15     One of the many cultures that sprang up from the untold number of city-states in western Etepezea and wealthiest of the groups that sprang up around the pre-Aautokrata city states,  Aeviaxians embody the mercantile nature of these city states to the utmost extent. Aeviaxian culture is one that values wealth and trade, with merchants being considered one of the foremost groups in society, second only to the nobility. They are moreover known for prizing communal bonds, aiding one another when in need. They are inclined towards establishing enclaves in settlements that lie on upon their trade routes, developing thriving communities in far off lands. While not unwilling to wage war when necessary, they are averse to it, as wars harm the operation of the trade routes vital to the Aeviaxian merchant class. Instead, the Aeviaxians are known for utilizing diplomacy and bribery to prevent what they see as wasteful conflicts.\n\nEventually, the Aeviaxians were integrated into Aversarian culture as a result of the Aautokrata's campaign to merge the cultures within it, forming a singular imperial culture.#"
 aelarvisian_desc:0 "#size:15   Originally inhabiting the countless city-states of what is presently western Etepezea, the Aelarvisians were an ancient culture that united the Shattered Coast and forged a mighty empire in blood. Infamous for their arrogance, but famed for the sternness of their people, Aelarvisians were masters of war who founded the first imperial armies that could truly be called legions, in contrast to the disorganized levies that preceded them. As a whole, they are renowned for aspiring to establish order through subjugation, and accordingly there have been many notable conquerors of Aelarvisian extract over the ages. \n\nBoth the nobility of the Aelarvisians and exceptional soldiers were known to eschew the riding of traditional mounts such as horses in favor of the legendary and terrible dragons. This earned them the moniker of 'dragonriders'. These dragonriders formed deep bonds with their mounts that transcended race and even blurred the line between servants and dear companions. \n\nAelarvisian culture would ultimately give way to [aversarian|E] culture as the Aautokrata redoubled its efforts to forge a new imperial identity out of the many identities within it.#"
 makryenis_desc:0 "#size:15    Makryenis refers to a melting pot of various [aversarian|E] cultures that would arrive in [sarradon|E] with the great wave of colonization that would follow the start of the [saints_war|E] in the 1140s, united only by a near-fanatical devotion to the Agionist creed. In their early years, they were known for their great social mobility and respect of meritocracy, and countless wretched souls on the Continent would brave the journey south for a chance at a better life in [sarradon|E]. Despite their modern reputation, they were also once considered a breath of fresh air on the continent, and as genuine facilitators of peace and a neutral third party to local squabbles and feuds.\n\nNowadays, though still going through great effort to paint themselves as honorable and righteous, their decline into general cruelty and capriciousness has made them infamous across [sarradon|E], and the Makryenis are usually looked down upon as a group of brutal thugs at best, or as loathsome tyrants to be driven back into the sea at worst.#"
 mondecny_desc:0 "#size:15    A largely peaceful and isolationist people, the Mondecny dwelt since time immemorial in the eastern portion of what is now known as the [foglands|E]. Though long sheltered from aggression by the mountains of the Krodgen range and the uniquely dense forests of their homeland, these natural defenses proved lacking with the arrival of the warlike [aversarians|E] who saw in the Mondecny a most invaluable resource - a population of slaves who were unlikely to revolt. Thus began the darkest era of their history.\n\nSo it was that when Cenware's coalition broke the back of [aversarian|E] resistance most Mondecny were brought into the Imperrech not from their traditional homelands, but from massive slave plantations located in the core of [aversaria|E]'s Katraddia governorship. Now freed after more than a generation of persecution and abuse, the Mondecny have settled in the dense Knokidbes forest in northern Malcois and many seem determined to resume their peaceful cultural traditions.#"
 huegodocs_desc:0 "#size:15    A cosmopolitan culture hailing from the territories on the far side of the Black Gate, the Huegodocs dwelt in a number of prosperous towns and cities along the Great River, collecting lucrative tolls and farming the rich soil. When the [aversarians|E] arrived they were lucky and shrewd enough to negotiate a relatively favorable deal for peace; non-citizen subjects, but still free men and women.\n\nThey were well on their way to assimilation within [aversarian|E] culture, and had a few more generations passed may have become almost indistinguishable from their Apokiakas neighbors when the [frodbrokna|E] struck Aeras. When it became clear that any [aversarian|E] efforts to rescue the local population from the encroaching [fog|E] were inadequate to save their local allies, the Huegodoc chose to throw in their lot with Cenware's coalition.#"
 sarminians_desc:0 "#size:15    The Sarminians are a matriarchal culture hailing from the far eastern edge of the lands now lost to the [fog|E], where the thick forests thinned into hills and steppes, and the vast empire of the Kathun-Kai is a more relevant threat than the distant [aversarians|E]. Their histories say that they were the western flank of a much larger nomadic federation, a rival and purported military equal to the Kathunians, but when the [frodbrokna|E] struck and the rest of their nation fled east, the Sarminians were unable to follow as the sea of [fog|E] cut off the route.\n\nForced to flee away from their kith and kin, they pushed deep into the west before encountering the Imperrech. Since joining forces with the Witch-breaker on the promise of new lands, the Sarminians have proven themselves fearsome warriors and as horsewomen skilled enough to rival the Kikarsags and Vanavids.#"
 voyagen_desc:0 "#size:15    The Voyagen originate from the northwestern backwaters of Chevalie. In search of more prosperous lands, they began sailing, seizing both other regions within the Marches and colonies on distant shores. Over time, these adventures and conquests would allow these adventurers to begin exerting influence over the rest of Chevalie. Due to both their military tradition and overseas holdings, the High King has almost always been Voyagen. This, in turn, has led to their culture increasingly becoming the metropolitan one of the nobility, as the other cultures of Chevalie slowly drift towards it. It is normal to find Voyagens employed as explorers, soldiers or in other such pursuits, and they are the face of the Marches to the outside world. \n\nVoyagen tradition places a large emphasis on individual accomplishment, and cooperation between them can be difficult. Many will seek their own personal glory, even when the route is more perilous. This has led to both triumphs and defeats throughout Chevalien history, and is, in part, responsible for the various warlord eras, along with simple greed. Despite this, the Voyagen will gladly fight the [liches|E] when they come south, standing alongside the rest of the Marchers.#"
 dawasid_desc:0 "#size:15    The Dawasid people that dwell in the far east of [sarradon|E] descend from the nomadic Mar'maladid tribes of the desert interior that settled among the numerous small-scale rivers of the Moranesh area. Despite their now largely sedentary lifestyle, they have not lost the warlike bent and ruthlessness of their roaming cousins to the west, and Dawasid culture is still very much one shaped by the harsh conditions of their land.\n\nIn particular, due to the extreme scarcity of any kind of natural resources of wealth, the Dawasids have taken up piracy and slave-raiding as an almost seasonal trade in and of itself, and their corsairs were once the most feared force of the east [sarradon|E]ian coast. In recent decades, however, they have been unable to compete with the organized, coordinated armadas of the Order of Saint Calysto's Key, and have themselves become one of the primary source of 'penitents' for the order.#"
 utyalid_desc:0 "#size:15    The Utyalid are the almost entirely nomadic people of the harsh deserts of east [sarradon|E]. Hardy men and women only managing to eke out a meagre existence in the best of times, they are known as desert warriors without equal, their understanding of the surrounding sandy wastes unparalleled by any other culture.\n\nQuite naturally, this skill was honed by centuries of raiding their settled neighbors for plunder, and generally making themselves a perennial thorn in the side of whatever the current dominant power of the region was. Their incursions most frequently strike Kekhenemhat, but the Gonan road is also a fairly popular target, and some ambitious chieftains have even went so far south as the lands of the Mogowai.\n\nTraditionally [wardenite|E] to the bone, they once dominantly followed the Harfi'a creed, but conversion efforts over the centuries have reduced it to only the most backwards of tribes deep in the desert interior.#"
 mutsartan_desc:0 "#size:15    The Mutsartan are the western branch of the Mar'maladid peoples, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle in the inhospitable Jayyal-el-Alfirk mountains. Though somewhat more settled than the Utyalid, they are considered to be none the more civilized, and some even consider them to be even more barbaric. Of course, this isn't helped in the slightest by the fact that, like seemingly all the other Mar'maladid cultures, they are all too happy to treat brigandry as a perfectly valid full-time occupation.\n\nWhat sets them apart from their brother cultures to the east, however, is their adherence to the strange religion known as 'Quwazaw' which they adopted in the indeterminate past. Attempts to trace the faith back to mainline [ritualism|E] or [wardenism|E] have all produced assertions based on shaky evidence at best, and scholars have remarked that the faith most closely resembles the Adabyssinians' worship of their golden statues, though how the Mutsartan could have picked up this tradition from them is unknown at present time.#"
 adnanari_desc:0 "#size:15    The Adnanari are the people of the east [sarradonian|E] kingdoms of Kekhenemhat. Though widely thought to descend from Mar'maladid tribes who completely abandoned their nomadic lifestyles and settled down in the Khenem river valley and the nearby coasts over a thousand years ago, their modern connection with the other Mar'maladid cultures can only be noticed by the astute scholar. Their languages have diverged to the point of complete mutual unintelligibility, and their customs even more so.\n\nControlling the critical juncture at which the Gonan road meets the north [sarradonian|E] coast, they have developed a strong commercial spirit, and have managed to offset the relative infertility of the Khenem river valley with income and imports from their mercantile endeavors. On the other hand, they have not quite lost the warrior spirit of their nomadic brethren, as constant warfare with raiders from the desert interior meant that martial prowess was still a skill in great need. This would serve them quite well when the Agionists arrived in the 12th century, and although they would ultimately be brutally subjugated, they were consistently the most rebellious group of people nominally under the [aversarians|E]' boot - and the first to successfully break free of their yoke in the [gh_agionists_faghira_jalil_revolt|E].#"
 jaduyada_desc:0 "#size:15    The Jaduyada are the people of the eastern Kharadamat peninsula of [sarradon|E]. Residing in the immediate vicinity of the great [tower|E] of Sophocos, their culture was very likely the cradle in which early [ritualism|E] grew in the distant, forgotten past, and they were some of the most stalwart Sophocists during the entirety of [war_in_heaven|E]. Intensely sectarian in nature, they were only united under a single banner once in recorded history, preferring to instead be divided amongst as many clans as the mind can imagine.\n\nOn the upside, they are also some of the most free-thinking people in all of [sarradon|E], and are often lambasted as being borderline libertine by their more conservative neighbors. The intellectual diversity fostered in this environment has resulted in a wealth of artistic and scientific heritage that was the envy of the rest of the continent for centuries.\n\nTheir almost complete conquest by the Saintly Orders in the 12th century would soon be followed by repressions of massive proportions, and what little of their intelligentsia were left alive after the [judges_massacre|E] in 1207 would soon seek refuge in neighboring lands instead. The Jaduyadas' simmering rage has grown with each decade of Agionist mistreatment, and the culture has become markedly less tolerant of outsiders than it had been in the past.#"
 hudi_desc:0 "#size:15    The Hudi of western Kharadamat are a people that have been defined by their faith for most of their history - even moreso than their neighbors. For millennia rejecting both [ritualism|E] and later [wardenism|E], they instead venerated Shub-Yuaguag - the Milk-Mother, despite attempts by preachers of both rival religions to convert them to their creed. Though increasingly adopting [wardenism|E] in the last few centuries, they are to this day known to be conservative to a fault. Abroad and in distant lands, they're far more well known for the quality of their artisanal goods - especially their weapons. It is said that a Hudi scimitar can cut through steel armor like a dagger through a piece of cloth, and they tend to fetch a similarly admirable price.\n\nWith the subjugation of the kingdom of Kudamash as a client state by the Agionists in 1161, they've found the rigid ways that define them to be increasingly at odds with their new [aversarian|E] masters. Fatefully joining the rebel cause in the [gh_agionists_faghira_jalil_revolt|E], they would become the prime target of Sansianite furor in the [gh_agionists_kahdavrakan_supper|E], and have since then largely fled their ancestral homelands for the relative safety of the Mamuramat. In crisis and without a home, mass conversions to [wardenism|E] have taken place, and it is likely that their ancient belief in the Milk-Mother is soon poised to disappear for good.#"
 tasurmad_desc:0 "#size:15    The Tasurmad are the people of the Bay of Sihnamiyah, frequently regarded as a region of Aeras with one of the longest records of settled, urban civilization. Starting from the legendary Hundred Cities that dotted the land starting some four thousand years ago, the area would come to be the birthplace of no less than four major empires over the next two millennia. With the collapse of the Arakkariac Empire in the 4th century BI, the local denizens would gradually come under the increasing sway of [ritualism|E], which would bring them into the growing sphere of pan-[sarradonian|E] culture.\n\nOwing to the fertile soil and pleasant climate of their homeland, they are rarely forced to endure a bad harvest, and their nobility is used to the kind of extravagant displays that would find themselves at home in Opakhasia or Sereksi. However, this decadence should not be confused for softness, as the Tasurmad have been more than capable of holding their own in the countless cycles of wars of expansion and collapse in their long history.#"
 amuaad_desc:0 "#size:15    Amuuad is perhaps best described as a cosmopolitan melting pot of virtually every major culture on the north coast of [sarradon|E]. Standing where the worlds of the [ritualist|E]-[wardenite|E] east meet exotic Kemsar, Amsari and Ayyar, seemingly every facet of their language and customs has been loaned from one of their neighboring people.\n\nTheir language shares most in common with the Tasurmad, but their script is completely unlike most other surrounding cultures - rather than using Jaduyada letters, they instead use the glyphs of ancient Kemsar, a legacy of the Ren Kemsari colonies founded in the region during their golden age. Their artwork is built upon an eastern bedrock, but with significant Ayyar elements, their architecture - distinctly Khemetic. Finally, Amuuad garb and cuisine are such a riotous mixture of everything under the Sun that trying to piece together the origin of each element would be a futile task indeed.#"
 mirzana_jahar_desc:0 "#size:15    As the Ayyar were a landless, wandering people in [sarradon|E] for centuries, it is perhaps unsurprising that some of their more unscrupulous hosts had a tendency to attempt to subdue and enslave them. Though the occasional Ayyar slave could be found across the continent, they would gradually come to be concentrated in Kemsar as slavery declined in popularity in the east. When the Battle of the Broken Chain shattered the Ren Kemsari for good, most of these Ayyar, known as the 'Mirzana Jahar', made their way east, where their Auzangeb brethren had recently established an independent state.\n\nThe Mirzana Jahar are arguably devoted to unity with their brother cultures even more than the Auzangeb. Their long ordeals as slaves has forged tight bonds among their community that persists to this day, and while they may be more than willing to overlook differences with their fellow Saradari, the same does not apply to outsiders. Ironically, though the Ren Kemsari persist as evil tyrants in their cultural memory even a thousand years after their destruction, it is undeniable even to a layperson that their artwork and customs have taken more than a few liberties in borrowing elements from their former masters.#"
 babura_desc:0 "#size:15    The Babura are the people of the arid, hilly Babur valley in the interior of the Ayyar Empire. The Saradari group with the least amount of common historical identity, they are mainly the descendants of Saradari that have slowly trickled into the region long after the establishment of the Empire, as scattered, disorganized migrants rather than a unified group. As land in the fertile Dokkdur valley was becoming scarce, they were instead redirected to settle in the foothills of the Saddur mountains to the east.\n\nLargely cut off from the coast and the cosmopolitan heart of Sereksi, they would adopt simple, pastoral lifestyles. Though often seen as ignorant yeomen by their compatriots, they are well-regarded as the hardiest warriors the Empire can field, and more than one battle against foreign invaders has been won through their seemingly indestructible stubbornness. This has also come at a cost, though - the Babura are notoriously hostile to any attempts to disrupt their lifestyle, and have spearheaded more than one revolt against the capital after it meddled in their affairs for too long.#"
 auzangeb_desc:0 "#size:15    The history of the Auzangeb is the story of Sereksi, the city that moves. Their tales still speak of the old, original metropole in their homeland, a city they claim was the greatest in all of Aeras. Yet today, nothing of their very oldest capital in the far east remains but a wistful memory, with some scholars even casting doubts on its existence. Since their arrival in [sarradon|E], the settlement bearing the name has been refounded thrice. The second Sereksi was on the miserable coasts of Ahradaban, and was destroyed by Mar'maladid aggression. The third, in the Bay of Sihnamiyah, and razed after choosing the wrong side in [war_in_heaven|E] one too many times. And of course, the fourth, final and current city, founded in the shadow of Kemsar, which would grow to become the opulent capital of one of the premier empires of west [sarradon|E].\n\nThe journeys of Auzangeb saw them meet cultures beyond count, many of which have not survived to the present day. Along the way to their current homeland, they have adopted foreign customs, art, and even ways of thinking in almost every aspect of their culture, but yet still maintain a strong set of traditions from their distant eastern homeland, and have come to see themselves as the natural leaders of all the Ayyar cultures on the sandy continent.#"
 jangkar_desc:0 "#size:15    The Jangkar are descended from the original Saradari diaspora in the eastern Bay of Kemsar, having arrived in the area long before most of their other brethren.

Though characterised by cliques and sub-cultures as countless as the cities of the region, they would slowly form a loose, common identity over the centuries and largely resist attempts at assimilation.\n\nWith the founding of the independent Ayyar state by the Auzangeb, they have gradually migrated away from the foreign cities that were so loath to accept their presence in the first place to the far more welcoming arms of their compatriots in Sereksi. Now largely settled along the eastern regions of the Empire, they mostly continue to live in communities determined by whatever foreign metropole they have originally arrived from. As such, it is difficult to pin down any universally shared cultural norms among them - perhaps a defining characteristic in and of itself.#"
 Ran_Kemsarian_desc:0 "#size:15    Ran Kemsarian, the 'Heartland Kemsari', are the people of what was once the imperial nexus of Kemsar.

With the seemingly final destruction of the Kemsarian Empire and drastically reduced mobility between the two halves of the former realm, their differences have grown even more extreme.\n\nDuring their heyday, they were perhaps one of the most decadent, opulent and artistically inclined peoples of their age. More liberal, cosmopolitan and urban than their southern kin, their influence on surrounding cultures was the strongest of all the Kemsari. Likewise, they were the group that has historically tended to adopt the most foreign habits - though of course, this was a fact that they fervently denied. Today, however, they have fallen far from the heights they once soared, and are a warlike, tribal culture barely scraping by in the searing wasteland that was once their bejeweled empire.#"
 Almajun_Kemsarian_desc:0 "#size:15    Though the north would come to be known as the heart of the Kemsarian Empire in its later years, it was southern Kemsar where imperial power and culture were concentrated for the first thousand or so years of its existence.

Due to their position deeper in the desert, the Almajun were hit perhaps the hardest of all the Kemsarian groups, and their relative isolation from the rest of the world has bred an intensely warlike, xenophobic set of customs where foreigners are treated almost as mythological monsters and agents of evil rather than mere mortals.

Rejected and scapegoated by their new neighbors, they were frequently victimized further with massacres and exile during the many [lich|E] invasions of the Marches. This would last until the reign of High Queen Arelli, who would drive them to the largely depopulated north where they would become a buffer against further [lich|E] incursions.

They have begun to assimilate to Chevalien culture, though still retain many distinctive traditions and customs. \n\nThe cultural practices of the Oejeynica are born of a fusion between Ojyczayn and Chevalien, from their unique dialect that blends the languages, to various everyday activities.

At the start the slaves were worked to death, brutalised, used in rituals by the practitioners, but they were far away from the readily available slaves the rest of the Empire had access to. As decadence soon took hold of the [magi|E], the chains on their slaves began to loosen. Over time the slaves were allowed more autonomy, able to have their own families (of course, born into servitude) and splitting cultures started to develop within the insular slaves.

But their servitude was not ended until Cenware and his hordes came and shattered the [magi|E], the Ukininhas realised their chance and rose up with their brethren driving their once masters back to their Academy.#"
 ojyczaynz_desc:0 "#size:15    Once, the Ojyczaynz were among the most advanced civilizations in the world, their achievements raising them far above the rest of [the_continent|E]. The cracks in their ascendancy would begin to show with the arrival of the Shewigads in the south. Having conquered the Gallicaders, their ambitions turned northwards, and a series of wars would ensue. The true downfall of the Ojyczaynz would arrive from amongst themselves, however, with the rise of [vilas_venslau|E], the first [lich|E]. In what would come to be known as the [sorrowing_of_oejeynica|E], the land itself would wither and die as the dead rose against the living, forcing panicked refugees to flee southwards. \n\nThough their homeland was lost, the Ojyczaynz found little mercy in Chevalie, facing centuries of persecution and blame. Whenever something went wrong, they were the first to whom fingers were pointed, and they lived in cramped slums within Chevalien cities, all else having been taken from them. When they were resettled northwards, many began drifting towards Chevalien culture, leaving many of their roots behind. This did not apply to all, however. A scant few continue to cling to their ancient ways, even as their numbers continue to dwindle. It will take a miracle to save the Ojyczaynz.#"
 meistras_desc:0 "#size:15   The Meistras were the house servants for the [magi|E]. Constantly being in the houses as servants put them in a unique position. They were able to move freely and mostly were left to their own devices by their masters. Their hubris and aura of superiority made them not look twice at the slaves and their daily chores. It was this non-caring attitude that allowed the Meistras to be the first of the slave castes to begin to have [magi|E] blood running through their veins and the first to start learning the words of power. They were allowed to start families and could pass off a child as their husbands when in reality it was not. \n\nCenwares invasion allowed the Meistras to seize the initiative and attack from the inside, slaughtering men, woman and children before they fully could comprehend what was going on. Before Cenware, revolt had been all but a pipedream, but now freedom was a very real proposition.#"
 mineris_desc:0 "#size:15   The most complacent of the slave castes, and with the shortest life span, the Mineris lived most of their life in the dark. Mostly sequestered to the North, where the mineral wealth was, they lived a simple life. Centuries of living life in low light had led their skin to turn noticeably whiter over the generations. They constantly dig and create new rooms, tunnels, and mines for their [magi|E] masters. While normal realms would sell their mineral wealth and use it for weaponry or armour, the [magi|E] would rather use it to perform exotic transmutation rituals. It was not until they saw the smoke billowing and recovered from their shock, did they seize the north. Since fear was the driving factor behind keeping the Mineris in check and the [magi|E] mostly fled back to defend the Academy, the seizure of the North was almost bloodless.#"
 skausmas_desc:0 "#size:15  The most unique of the slave cultures, the Skausmas were also the most changed. Living the closest to [the_mayikprolollan|E] in unique buildings designed for the [magi|E], their bodies warped by their proximity to the Academy. While it was this that drove them to despise magic, it was the role the [magi|E] used them for that made them hate their masters. As the depths of magic were explored by [magi|E] it took a toll on both their mind and body. It would not take long for their partners to grow afraid and find themselves alone in bed. That is where the Skausmas come in, to play out any fantasies their master's demented minds dreamt up. \n\nAt first when Cenware attacked, the Skausmas were content to sit back and watch their world burn. It was not until fear of their masters being replaced by another from barbarian tribes did they revolt.#"
 goan_desc:0 "#size:15    The Goans passed through the Black Gate with Cenware, though are not, themselves, Sjalvolki. They originate from atop a mountain range, having survived the altitude since the distant past. Goan dwellings were carved into cliffsides, many having stood longer than the tribes that lived in them, with some even claiming that these dwellings had been theirs since the beginning of time. They once herded goats upon the heights, and would periodically war amongst themselves over the few productive pastures to be found in the mountains. The sheer peaks of their homeland isolated them from the outside world, and they were only vaguely aware of it.  \n\nThis would end with the [frodbrokna|E], when their dwellings collapsed, their pastures split open, and rocks began to rain from the sky. Forced to unite, they began an exodus from the mountains, where they would encounter the burgeoning host of Cenware, joining him in his invasion of [aversaria|E]. With their homeland now lost to them, the Goans now face an unfamiliar world, torn between a desire to seek out mountains and resume their ancient ways, or embrace the pastures and fertile plains of their new lands.#"

While their cousins were conquering foreign lands, they stuck to their traditional way of life, staying within their rural homes. They are almost entirely farmers, with their vast fields providing sustenance for much of the Marches. Their lands have often been battlefields, the repeated civil wars and [lich|E] invasions having touched nearly everywhere they inhabit. These threats have united them, forming a culture where collaboration and community are prized. \n\nTheir close internal ties have only strengthened the perception of the rest of Chevalie, that the Trustians are meant to follow, not lead. Though others may prize strong leadership, they seek stability, as the rest of the nation tears itself apart repeatedly over ambition, they continue their lives. Though they inhabit many of the poorest regions of the Marches, partially on account of the wars fought upon its ground, they are content with their lot. Whatever fate awaits Chevalie, the Trustians will stand together against it, as they have so many times before.#"
 kardwens_desc:0 "#size:15    The Kardwen have hunted within their native forests, animals and men alike for time immemorial. To Sjalvolki children they are the demons which will snatch them away from their beds at night, if they misbehave. To [aversarians|E] they are the shades in the dark which have resulted in the disappearance of many a legion. But to their own kin, they are the chosen people who liberated mankind from the chains of the Titan Mawloc by feasting upon his body. Ever since, the Kardwen have continued the hunt of those unfortunate enough to wander into their ancestral homeland. To those who have not seen them with their own eyes, they are mere nightmares, spirits which the elders warn the curious children about. \n\nThe Kardwen are proud hunters, devouring the bodies of their enemies and trespassers, except for their heads, as that is where the soul resides, instead they are worn as testaments to ones ability as a warrior or as decorations in a war-chief's hall. As long as the head remains, they are unable to enter the afterlife and feast amongst the gods, forever stuck peering out of their own hollow eyes. However, the days of head-hunters have become a distant memory, strange folk from the east have displaced the slayers of Mawloc. The Kardwen have had to seek refuge amongst those who they once called prey, torn between keeping to their traditions now they are no longer sheltered amongst the trees, or adapting and learning to live alongside those they once hunted.#"
 fenvir_desc:0 "#size:15    Despite being amongst the smallest of the clans, Fenvir warriors would more than make up for their lack of numbers in sheer ferocity. Most lived a life of modest comforts high upon windswept hills, tending to their flock or fishing alongside the few rivers which graced their lands, eking out a humble, if meager existence. When winter came to their northern pastures, they would march their livestock further south, bartering their quality fleece for tools and weapons. Their true calling, however, would be to venture forth from their simple abodes to foreign lands in search of glory and plunder - whether through payment for their services on the battlefield, or more usually, taking it themselves.\n\nThe Fenvir were among the first to witness the madness of [the_fog|E] descend from their hills, but due to their already semi-nomadic lifestyle faced much less of a shock upon confronting the prospect of leaving their highlands forever.#"
 gallicads_desc:0 "#size:15    The Gallicads are the ancient people of the Marches, who dwelt in its magic-devoid hills and valleys for centuries before the arrival of the Shewigads. It is a matter of some debate how much, if any of modern Marcher culture has its roots in the peoples it replaced. While the ancient Epic of King Bastione narrates that the founder of Chevalie and his heroic knights fought momentous battles to secure a home free from the wicked Gallieni, there is also evidence that many of the cornerstones of Marcher custom and tradition were adopted from these precursor peoples, suggesting that not all contact between the two may have been so aggressive.\n\nRegardless of the truth of the events that transpired during that legendary age, the Gallicads today only persist in pockets amongst the hills and mountains, marginal land spared Marcher settlement only due to its poor, rocky soil and the stubbornness of its inhabitants. There they dwell, continuing the traditions of their ancestors in reclusive communities. Their society is segmented into hierarchical castes which determine the specific roles and careers an individual may pursue throughout life."
 adrakamp_desc:0 "#size:15    The northern lowlands were home to some of the most metropolitan Sjalvolki societies, the Adrakamp key among them. Merchants from across all clans flocked to their settlements in hopes of selling their wares, anything a tribesman might need could be found in an Adrakamp market. This prosperity was ironically bron from their homeland's poor fertility and mountainous terrain causing them to trade in order to sustain their population. The driving necessity to keep the wealth flowing taught the Adrakamp chieftains the subtle art of diplomacy to avoid the more bloody aspects of Sjalvolki clan politics. Instead of fighting for territory, the Adrakamp were called to mediate disputes between rival tribes, and Adrakamp towns were neutral ground for the purposes of commerce and diplomacy, with blood feuds and vendettas becoming legally null the moment a clansman crossed into their territory. This is not to say these mercantile clans were craven, when attacked the Adrakamp would defend themselves as would be expected of any other Sjalvolki.\n\nHowever, the Adrakamp could not defend themselves from all threats. [the_fog|E] forced them from their markets and onto the road. Many among the tribe worry that their age old prosperity is lost forever.#"
 rivarisians_desc:0 "#size:15    Nestled between the Konijkmener and the Chevaliens, the Rivarisians have long made a living traversing the canals and rivers between the two. Though originally kin of the Konijkmener, they have become more Chevalien over the centuries, integrating aspects of both into a unique blend. They place a strong emphasis on the water, with fishing becoming a replacement for farming in many settlements, and trade along the water being their main form of interaction with the world outside of their swamps. The construction of canals in the region was welcomed by the Rivarisians, who would rapidly integrate into the trade along them, filling roles from captains to dockworkers. \n\nDue to their position between realms, the Rivarisians are a melting pot of Konijkmener and Chevalien traditions, language, and beliefs. Their language is famously indecipherable, integrating a variety of stolen phrases and words into a nonsensical grammatical structure. To the Chevaliens, the Rivarisians are more Konijkmener than Chevalien, and looked down upon heavily, while few among the Konijkmener care how some sailors to the north speak. To most Rivarisians, however, this does not matter, for most care for little else than the boat beneath their feet and the oar in their hands.#"
 shewigads_desc:0 "#size:15    The Shewigads are the precursors to the modern Chevaliens, having migrated into the region over a millennia ago. Prior to their migration, they had existed for centuries as a group of tribes, fighting amongst themselves over resources and grudges. This age of internal conflict would be brought to an end by the Ethylisiads, who would conquer and enslave them. Over their centuries of oppression, the Shewigads would learn the ways of civilization from their masters, beginning their metamorphosis. Eventually, they would rise against their masters, though who exactly led them in this is unclear. Some claim that "Sir Ranos", the figure who supposedly led them in rebellion, is nothing more than a fairy tale, while others claim that Ranos was simply Bastione. \n\nNonetheless, it is known that after their revolt, Bastione would unify them, and lead them westward into the lands now known as Chevalie. The native Gallicads would be conquered through a series of wars, leaving the land open for their settlement. Over the centuries since, the Shewigads have mixed with the Gallicads, forming into the people of modern Chevalie. Though none living can now be considered Shewigad, their legacy lives on in the myriad of Chevalien cultures.#"
 urdermantern_desc:0 "#size:15   The Urdermantern are a people native to the vast network of salt marshes that line the estuary leading to Gradiene, capital of De Kanzerlerij. A traditionally conservative and superstitious folk, the hostility of their homeland has discouraged the widespread development typical of coastal Konijkmener settlements. Instead of polders and dikes used to tame the wetlands, while traveling through Urdermantern country one bears witness to a simple people living off the wealth of the sea much like their forebears. Because of this the Urdermantern are known as expert fishermen, and from a young age learn the art of sailing.\n\nDue to the underdeveloped economy of their homeland, many Urdermantern as of late have left their native marshes seeking economic opportunity elsewhere. In fact, among the great port cities of the Kanzerlerij and even off in Peti Gisredde Urdermanterns can be found working in foreign docks and fisheries. Strong Urdermantern marines and sailors are also not uncommon in the far traveling Konijkmener and Voyagen trade fleets. However, despite their traditional maritime skills, the Urdermantern remain an oft-forgotten footnote in Konijkmener society.#"

Once upon a time they were ascendant, overlords of a great kingdom composed of other southern Sjalvolki tribes forced into paying tribute. They were ruled by the Teyberl Kings, and in contrast to modern Sjalvolki theology insisted that it was the god of fate who was foremost among the pantheon, for it was he who commanded [velos|E] to grant man his gifts and their stipulations. In practice the functional differences caused by this alteration were few outside of basic rituals, but while the Teyberl Kings were strong it allowed them to justify their role as paramount clan. Times were good.\n\nAnd then the Teyberl Kings fell to squabbling amongst themselves. The Great Kingdom of the Greulokin was lost in just one generation of strife as its tributaries revolted, and its ruling clans were forced to moderate their pride. Still, the Greulokin carry on practicing their oddly reorganized pantheon, and they have never forgotten that they were once kings among men."
 ashital_desc:0 "#size:15   The Ashital are the most prosperous and largest division of the Canian people, their society centered around the two great metropoli of Shenidad and Bet-Adis. The two cities' people have produced the bulk of Canian literature and culture, but neither have enjoyed more than fleeting periods of independence from the outside powers which have often dominated them throughout the centuries. While this has culminated in a number of revolts and ensuing attempts to suppress their odd religious practices, fear of disrupting the lucrative commerce flowing through the region has led to the cities usually enjoying a tenuous local autonomy.\n\nThe Ashital, despite being what most outsiders think of when they imagine a Canian, have absorbed a number of cultural practices from their Ayyar and Amsari neighbors. Many have come to take pride in their cosmopolitan heritage, and hold a belief that they are the most cultured and literate people in West Sarradon."
 leviden_desc:0 "#size:15   The drier environs and distance from any commercially valuable river systems mean that the Leviden never achieved the same level of prosperity as their Ashital cousins to the south. Nevertheless they are a hardy people, and have successfully harnessed the Four Rivers of Kabyar to turn significant portions of their territory into fertile, farmable land. Unfortunately this also made the region a target for foreign aggression, and in IS 615 the disunited Leviden kingdoms were brought under the rule of the Amsari Hiklahn. While they are far from slaves, the Leviden people have lost considerable ground in the ensuing centuries to Zaoranian settlers.\n\nLeviden culture tends to be more isolationist and conservative than their Ashital relatives, whom some even go so far as to accuse of having abandoned Canian practices and the religion of Eloi. Leviden villages often appear as clustered houses formed into a fortified compound, both to emphasize their clannish separation from the outside world and to defend against Ran Kemsari raiders ranging far down the dry Iteru riverbed."
 simevian_desc:0 "#size:15   The smallest of the three Canian cultures, the Simevians are the nomadic people of old Kabyar, traditionally eschewing permanent settlement for a more itinerant lifestyle. While the Ashital and even the Leviden tend to regard their wayward cousins as little better than savages, in truth the lines between settled 'civilized' farmers and wandering 'barbarian' herders tend to be blurred in the margins of rural society. When farming is no longer an option many Canian agriculturalists fall back on nomadism with their goats and sheep to survive. Thus, a surprising number of Simevian clansmen are in reality only a generation or two removed from their settled brethren.\n\nThey are a devout people, and though their settled cousins may sneer at their parochialism they are renowned for their poetry and notorious for their resourcefulness. As their identity is in large part built from their hard-bitten lifestyle as opposed to any geographical origin, adoption of outsiders and even slaves into Simevian clans is a widespread practice, and those who are so adopted can rise far if they ambitious."
 curgerski_desc:0 "#size:15    The Curgerski were few in number even before the Frodbrokna, and fewer still now. They were northmost of the northern tribes to make it out of the [foglands|E], having been pushed out into the marginal and cold territories spurned by larger and more powerful clans in ages past. Before the Imperrech led them out into the wider world they never had cause to adopt permanent settlements nor to become farmers, instead eking out an existence as nomadic hunters and reindeer herders in a harsh land. Their tools and weapons were often made of simple bone and stone since their lands were barren of any accessible metal deposits, and most Cugerski tribes were too poor for many traders to bother with. Because of this they were derided as savage and primitive by their fellow Sjalvolki.\n\nNow settled in former Aversarian territory they have slowly adopted some of the trappings of the more 'civilized' clans, but the old ways do not die easy. Cugerski clans are notoriously insular and distrustful of outsiders - a category which includes most other Sjalvolki."

They achieved infamy during the years of warfare with the [aversarian|E] by working as guides and scouts, earning them an evil reputation amongst their coreligionists. Nevertheless, their canny navigation of the turbulent politics in the borderlands between invader and invaded brought prosperity to the Barki, who acted as middlemen in commerce between the southerners and the people of the north. At no point however did they earn the full trust of the Aversarians, with Barki guides' duplicity being suspected as the cause of the Chorres Massacre in IS 1067, and the bloodless and embarrassing failure of the punitive Ichiteron campaign in IS 1086. Nothing was ever conclusively proven, but it was likely that the Barki were well on their way to a violent reckoning with their allies when the Frodbrokna struck.\n\nThe most 'Aversarianized' of the Sjalvolki, there was little love lost between the Barki and the clans of the Imperrech, resulting in the two parting ways almost immediately after the Battle of Elysian Pass had seen them safely beyond the [foglands|E]."

Cut off from the rest of Sjalvolki society, their language and customs became alien to those they once called brethren, incorporating yelps, howls and whistles into their tongue in order to take full advantage of their home's natural acoustics. Their isolation did not last forever. Greulokin marauders arrived, seeking to seize the region's rich mineral deposits for themselves. Despite numbering thrice as many as their overlords, the inhospitable terrain of their homeland and fractious nature of their clans rendered it impossible to release the Greulokin yoke. Their time came when for reasons unknown to them the Greulokin fell into civil war, leading to the dissolution of their once mighty realm.\n\nPeace did not last for the Vrodkin, whilst many wished for a return to the life of their ancestors, the cruel winds of [the_fog|E] forced their people into a second exodus to lands unknown.#"

The gods granted them their wish, and from their wombs grew the first trees. The Tribocicai claim that the first of their clansmen fell from these trees a fruit. They bury a portion of their harvests, each year as an offering to the sisters in hope that the following years crop will be even more bountiful.\n\nAlthough, the Tribocicai yearn for their farmsteads and fields of old, they have found their new home to be even more fruitful, for as long as there is land under their feet they know they are under the protection of their ancestors.#"

Much of these stories originate from the proud history of the Blood-Hounds catalogued on great runestones, inscribed with descrpitions and glyphs of great conquerors and adventurers.

Battered by centuries of [lich|E] invasion, their culture was shaped by their need to stand against the odds. As cities burned and fortresses fell, they learned to rebuild stronger, taking each mistake and improving upon it. Though the other Chevaliens are adept at the construction of fortresses, the Carsavisians are masters, their towering edifices having been shaped through bitter experience. The constant quest for improvement has become integral to their identity, with failure being merely an obstacle, a test in preparation for eventual success. \n\nViewing the world through this lens, they care less about punishing a failure and more about learning from it. Their Wayfathers are famously lenient, so long as improvement is made. Those who give up, however, are rejected from their society, for the Carsavisians believe that sheer grit can overcome any challenge. Many of Chevalie's greatest success stories originate from them, stories which are then reintegrated as goals to be striven for. Whatever fate awaits them, they will surely embrace it, accepting it as merely another obstacle to overcome.#"

They have instead merged, bringing aspects of their own individual traditions together, creating a cosmopolitan superculture encompassing the realm. Vestiges of nearly every custom once practiced within the region can be found within it. \n\n What exactly defines Chevalien culture is a much-debated question, with people of the many cultures that make it up each claiming that it is defined by their particular traditions. As far as can be agreed upon, there is no individual characteristic that stands out. What makes it unique is the mixture of practices, their combination forming something completely new. The Salisian artisans have gained Carsavarian determination, the Voyagen have lit a flame within the Trustians, and the Rivarisians have woven their language into the common tongue.

Imperial authorities learnt of the atrocities and swiftly ended the practice worried that the loss in population may disrupt the Malcois economy.

Of course this practice ended with the [aversarian|e] conquest, although the cult of Lady Selva was incorporated into the Iyrossi Aagiokratian religon, becoming one of its prime deities. The lake they had called home since time begun was left in an uninhabitable state after the occupation of Malcois, and those who survived found refuge in lands to the west.

The leader of those who accepted this oath was named Irmi, and so would his tribe be called the People of Irmi, or Irmionoth. \n\nSeeking to uphold this contract, they began training, becoming ever more skilled at the arts of war. When the tribe was wronged, they would descend upon their enemy with a fury unmatched, and avenge every perceived slight. Internally, they held to a simple code, that everything must be proportional. If one were to be caught thieving, they would be required to return something of equal value in addition to the stolen goods. A feud would require the rivals to battle to the death, and so they were only invoked at harsh transgressions. With their entry into [aversaria|E], they have come to finally make the Empire pay its due.#"

Seen as a 'civilised tribe' by their [aversarian|e] overlords, they were used as an engineered middle class in the colonial settlements which sprung up all over the Iyrossi Basin. Despite this, the Cerussiai were never quite absorbed into imperial stock, partly due to [aversarian|e] efforts to keep the two groups distinct and partly due to them wishing to keep their own traditions alive. The Cerussiai were afforded liberties which their Iyrossi brethren did not, and enjoyed the benefits of it. However, now the tables have turned.

They have an aversion to meat, supplanting their vegetarian diet with beetles, locusts, and wild honey. The most revered figures in Brigandine society are the Scrivers, powerful [magi|E] who serve as chroniclers and advisors for the tribe. In the western region of the [greensea|E], trees are carved with runes detailing the Partic history and magical spells.

To their fellow Damotans, they are seen as traditionalist and uptight, maintaining practices that have long since been abandoned in other regions. One such example are their funerals, with a body simply left to the jungle in the same fashion as was practiced in [pre_boqqarut_damota|E]. It is also considered normal among them to attempt to trace one's lineage back to ancient times, though many simply invent their family histories. \n\nIn seeming contrast with their focus on the past, the Kawoch also place great emphasis on the aquisition of knowledge, with many being members of [rayakuux|E], sharing their experiences and seeking out adventure. As a result, the [rayakuux|E] are most prevalent and powerful within their lands, and it is rare to find a settlement of any size that lacks one, with even the smallest villages having local chapters.

 kutma_desc:0 "#size:15    Traditionally the smallest of the Damotan cultures, the history of the Kutma is one of defiance, lined with heroes who never gave in to superior odds. As a result of this, they have formed a proud warrior culture, exhalting bravery and strength on a level not seen amongst other Damotan cultures. Settlements retain largely-ceremonial rivalries, and it is expected for settlements to engage in a form of ritualized combat over perceived slights, though upholding their code of honor is critical even within these battles.#" \n\nThough war and honor are prized highly among the Kutma, this is not to say that they are exclusively warlike. It is considered just as critical to fulfill one's other duties, and the feuds and skirmishes are limited enough that this does not become a problem. It should come as no suprise that the [waranuux|E] are the most prevalent of the [lodges|E], with both having fed into one another.

This constant work has caused them to prize effort and edifice, being known across Damota for their determination and fortitude. Their emphasis on collective effort has also forged strong bonds within their communities, an aspect of their culture which has a deep and visible impact. \n\nTheir society is largely dominated by the [qabuux|E], which have embraced and strengthened their bonds of kinship, forming into massive extended families. These groups themselves live within the grand structures the Fedagesh are known for. Though the [qabuux|E] command large influence, many are not members, instead continuing their lives in a method that has continued since the region was settled.

It was their prophet who foretold the freedom of the Zarasadari peoples, and their warriors and magi who made good on that promise of liberation. Every Amsari child learns this from birth, and as a result their culture has developed a deep and abiding pride in their status as free men and women. The very idea of enslavement is considered abhorrent to their society, something born of a nightmare conjured out of the darkest days of their history. Legally, any slave who remains on Amsari soil when the sun sets is immediately rendered free - though actual enforcement of this law upon those foreign merchants foolish enough to bring their slaves with them has been lax at best.#"

Every man and woman from the age of thirteen who can be spared from fieldwork is expected to be trained to fight with a spear, and many Thyssae towns are heavily fortified. Because of this, when Amsari Hiklhan armies march to war, their ranks are often swelled with Thyssae recruits. On the other hand, this manpower has also meant that the Thyssae have been able to assert de facto independance from the rest of the Amsari on no less than two occasions during times of extreme crisis for the Qanamsar, both periods lasted for the better part of a century before control was restored.#"

Young men are obligated to join a böta, otherwise they are ostracized and are ineligible for marriage. Youths are only considered adults when they kill an enemy, though this can include prisoners and criminals. Before the [frodbrokna|E], bötai were used as auxiliaries in the eastern legions, though now they hunt for [aversarians|E] to kill so that they may become Chosen Men.\n\nLike all Kikarsagi cultures, the concept of 'ardara', or honor, is held in high regard. To the Sycharcegs, to have ardara is to be brave in combat, to slaughter one's enemies and their people, and to be pure of blood. Purity of blood is gained through killing enemies and the impure; formerly these were the enemies of [aversaria|E], but now the [aversarians|E] themselves must be slain to attain purity.\n\n[magi|E] in general and [blood_magi|E] in particular hold great power in Sycharceg society, serving mainly as a priestly class.

Csorsca youths - both men and women - must join a böta to be considered an adult. The Csorsca concept of ardara - honor - revolves around obedience to [magi|E] and the pureblooded, along with prowess in [magic|E]. The purer one's blood and the more powerful a [magi|E] one is, the more ardara they possess. Before the [frodbrokna|E], the Csorsca held the [aversarians|E] as the purest of all men, but after the dissolution of [aversaria|E] they have come to the conclusion that they must take and uphold the Mandate of Purity.\n\nCsorsca society is strongly tied to its [magi|E]-kings, who reign in [aversarian|E] fashion and who wear a combination of [aversarian|E] and Kikarsagi clothing.

This 'cult of the head' features prominently in Kunsag culture, and originates from [aversarian|E] lords deploying Kunsag horsemen to crush slave revolts, as the [aversarians|E] would pay them for each head collected.\n\nThe Kunsag conception of ardara - honor - revolves around how many heads one has claimed; the more heads one has, the more ardara they possess. Kunsag warriors often have skulls tied to their belts and horses, and sometimes incorporate their skull collections into their clothing.\n\n[magi|E] serve an important role in Kunsag society, acting mainly as spiritual leaders, they may also be rulers of a clan.

As both Ozkan and Betun exemplified the Old Kikarsagi ideal of ardara, the Atrakaran conception of it is very similar.\n\nLike all Kikarsagi cultures, the bötai is an important part of Atrakaran society; in emulation of Ozkan and Betun, both men and women must join a böta and participate in a raid to be considered an adult and eligible for marriage.

To hear the Daukeni tell it, their homeland is blessed with plentiful game, bountiful rivers, and a climate perfectly balanced between heat and cold to produce the toughest and bravest warriors in the whole of Aeras, and certainly among the Sjalvolki people. The Daukeni have never felt that the gods' gifts to mankind have ever been far from sight, and that they themselves are the primary beneficiaries of that bounty. As with the rest of the Sjalvolki the Daukeni have tended towards disunity, with each clan competing with its rivals for territory and glory.\n\nMost noteworthy among Daukeni cultural traditions is their rich repertoire of epics and sagas, with each clan sporting their own set of ancestral heroes.

Delmex 'Two-Eyes', Menwir 'Woodwolf' and Arnold 'Toadface' are the names of but a few of those legendary enough to achieve immortality in the hearts and minds of Daukeni everywhere.\n\nOne of these most widely retold sagas explains the origin of the Daukeni themselves, tracing that legacy to the first man to ever use a bow. With a single arrow he felled a great and monstrous bear the size of an entire hill, the beast having terrorized his people for years. Upon butchering the mountainous carcass he found a beautiful woman curled within its stomach - none other than Prozeka, the daughter of Velos the Hunter who had been swallowed whole by the villainous Prohen as an infant.

Only tasked with guarding a short border with the Lichdoms, the Salisians instead turned towards other pursuits. Fueled by investments from the ever-feuding church and nobility, the Salisians began developing advanced artisanal skills, especially in the realm of metalworking, with the nearby mountains serving as a source of material. With centuries of practice, they would reach a point where their weapons were superior to all those produced within the Marches, cementing themselves as the "Forge of Chevalie". \n\nThis prestigious position has become ingrained in their culture, with a level of reverence shown to craftspeople comparable to that shown to Anti-Magi. It is heavily encouraged for a child to try their hand at an apprenticeship, and as such they are quite difficult to come across.

Because of this the Warisnik were known as skilled hunters, similar to their more primitive Curgerski cousins to the north. However primordial their lands seemed however the Warisnik were a settled people, living in fortified wooden settlements on the boundaries of the tundra. Their brave chiefs would lead hunting expeditions out on the plains bringing back all manner of strange tusks and pelts.

Their speech appears antiquated and indecipherable, to their brethren, a strange cocktail of words and features not present in Konijkemener language for centuries alongside phrases incorporated from the Marchers. Leegender jewellers and glass-smiths are seen as the finest in Chevalie, impossible detail and intricate colours installed into each peice, their craft kept secret by a handful of rich, artisanal families.

 islander_desc:0 "#size:15    Traditionally hailing from Outaradeikós, the Imperial Isle, [aversarian|E] islanders have a culture no less ancient than that of their cousins from Etepezea - a fact they are notoriously quick to point out at every opportunity. Indeed, over the centuries something of a cultural rivalry has emerged between the two peoples, each claiming a unique connection to the ancient past of the [aversarian|E] people. Isolated from Continental affairs by the Etepezea channel, the Islanders' culture has slowly turned its focus inwards upon their antique past over the long centuries of the Aautokrata. Much of the island has developed a reputation for a sort of idyllically rustic character. That they live around some of the most well-preserved ruins and artifacts from early [aversaria|E] has turned the islander's home into a popular destination for tourists from all across the [aversarian|E] world - a market the Islanders have been quick to cater to. Many of the ancient city states and villages of the Imperial Isle purport to maintain rituals they have faithfully practiced since primeval days and which they are more than happy to demonstrate for a paying audience of Mainlanders. While many of these rituals have some kind of historic origin, their modern reenactments are mostly for show. \n\nWhile the inimical differences between Etepezeans and Islanders are considered obvious and clear by the latter, [aversarians|E] from other parts of the Aautokrata usually fail to find and appreciable differences between the two, and usually regard them as a single culture. The traditional colors associated with the Islanders are purples, blues, and reds.#"
 centralislander_desc:0 "#size:15    The inhabitants of the rocky and poor islands of the Shattered Coast, Central Islanders are surely the most overlooked [aversarian|E] people. Aironoi has its gold and silver, Malcois has its teeming mass of slaves, Etepezea has its treasured antiquity and even Katraddia has its vast size and untapped natural resources. The Central Islanders, however? Their is a hard-bitten life, occupying rocky islands often quite remote from civilization. If Opakhasia has an idyllic spring it's because the rage of the Sea of Empires has expended itself against the islands of the Shattered Coast. If Etepezea risks starvation due to crop failure then it is the bounty of the Islands' fishermen - the region's only noteworthy natural resource - which is pillaged to avoid famine, a sacrifice for which there is never thanks nor reward. The Central Islanders have no traditional colors, for they are barely thought of as a people at all by their fellow [aversarians|E].\n\n In spite of their cultural obscurity, Central Islanders can be found in most [Aversarian|E] coastal towns and villages, selling all manner of fish, eels, and crabs harvested from the teeming waters of the Sea of Empires. They have a reputation for being cold and unfriendly to outsiders but to their fellow Central Islanders they show a different face, generous to the point of self sacrifice. It is not uncommon for the survivors of shipwrecks to be adopted wholesale into Central Islander families, and are treated as equals if they can prove their worth. The other reputation the Central Islanders hold is for their frankly bizarre and labyrinthine series of superstitions regarding the sea. They have constructed several peculiar religious traditions and rituals found nowhere else in the Aautokrata.\n\nFor Central Islanders seeking fortune elsewhere, the only reliable way they find to escape their poor circumstances is service in the Marine LEgions, whose ranks are swelled each year by youngsters seeking anything but a life spent repairing nets and crab traps, to the point that their ranks are nearly entirely composed of young Islanders.#"
 charchac_desc:0 "#size:15    Found in the southeast of the Armazli Mountains, the Charchac people are defined by their stubborn fervour. Their insularism has been driven by a cultural enmity between them and their neighbours, their traditions and religion often dismissed as bizarre. Their ancient history saw them ruled over by a powerful priestly caste, who controlled every aspect of their lives. At the age of six, half of all Charchac children would be chosen for a life as a priest or a warrior, and only those that failed would be allowed to take another trade.\n\nHowever, their culture radically shifted as a result of Amaghean conquest. The priestly caste was relegated to the bottom of Charchac society, and a raiding culture became the core of their existence. With their people being treated as less than human by their Amaghean slave lords, Charchac clans regularly raid the lands of the Amagheans to kidnap their women and children, burning them on great pyres. However, despite the fervent hatred in their hearts, the Charchac people have never managed to regain their ancient dominance.#"

Despite this outward coldness, they pride themselves on their extensive guest rites. It is said that even their most hated enemies will not be refused the right of protection should they seek a Draneti home for aid.\n\nAs a result of their honour, the Draneti have been the favoured slaves of their Amaghean neighbours for centuries. Often serving in the homes of their masters rather than toiling on plantations, the Draneti have been treated favourably long enough to grown accustomed to their station. Their lack of open resistance to Amaghea has also destroyed many of their early warrior traditions, leaving the Draneti a relatively diplomatic group in times of both peace and war.#"

However, many of the earliest champions of these priests also founded great bloodlines, and their descendants formed a secular rival to their power.\n\nThe Aygaens have historically been the most vocal opponents of the Amagheans in their home region but have also attempted the least revolts, owing to a lack of any great strategic minds. With the temples closed and their nobility scattered, the Aygaens have become a more communal people, sharing the struggle as a community rather than relying upon their predatory aristocracies for help.#"
 konijkmener_desc:0 "#size:15    Hailing from the southern peninsula of Chevalie, the Konijkmener have gained the reputation of a proud and industrious people. Historically, they were a people united in taming the miserable swamps of their homeland.

They built polders and dikes to allow for vast swathes of farmland to be created in the low wetlands. They learned to build canals to protect their cities from the fickle tides. In a feat of human engineering, the Konijkmener dug a canal that completely separated their peninsula from the rest of Chevalie. \n \n Despite their history of Marcher independence, they share similar cultural values such as exploration and mercenary traditions.

 amaghean_desc:0 "#size:15    Ancient tales speak of the Amagheans being descendants of the martyred God-King Arnaz 'the Great Ancestor' and his child Parnaz 'the Great'. Infamous for their religious zeal and warrior culture, they are often said to be unafraid of death itself when in combat - in fact, falling in battle is considered the most noble way one can die in their culture. The Amagheans have a long history of practicing slavery, for they believe all peoples to their east deserve to be punished for aiding Azot 'the Kinslayer'. Some of these cultures have, over many centuries, even been entirely eradicated because of their disloyalty, yet some have stayed in the good graces of their masters, such as the Draneti. With the arrival of [aversarian|E] influence to their homelands, the Amagheans were awed by their foe's prowess and valor, and many were even open to the idea of adopting the Aversarian rites. However, it was only during the reign of Dedaphal Mariamne 'the Builder' that the Amaghean Aagiokratia was officially adopted and became a mainstay of Amaghean life.#"
 theugombrians_desc:0 "#size:15    The Theugombrians have no homeland. They have wandered the Continental interior since time out of memory, occasionally setting down roots on small patches of wasteland to farm or herd in heavily fortified communities, but more often roaming in great caravans, setting down fortified camps for a few weeks or months at most. Their culture stresses both discipline and martial training for youths of both sexes and they are often referred to by chroniclers and poets as an army without a country. Indeed they often sell their services as mercenaries or auxiliaries to anyone who will pay. Their culture seems to hold little guard for distinctions between sexes, placing equal responsibilities upon both men and women both within the Theugombrian household and while under arms. Additionally, It is not uncommon for Theugombrian women to take multiple husbands, sometimes up to three, though the reverse among Theugombrian men is exceedingly rare.\n\nTheir nature as permanent outsiders and nomads has made the Theugombrians the frequent victims of suspicion and distrust by their settled neighbors, an attitude they are more than willing to reciprocate if needed. While they have occasionally been the victims of mob violence, the heavily armed and militarized nature of their society means that this often ends badly for their aggressors, and most towns with a tendency towards xenophobic paranoia have learned to swallow their prejudices and leave them well enough alone in their fortified camps.\n\nTheir tightly knit kin-groups are based around matrilineal lineages which can in some families be reliably traced back over fifty generations. Indeed, a few of the oldest histories written by the societies of the Continental Interior mention a people clearly recognizable as Theugombrians, implying that they have held onto a discernable cultural identity far older than almost any people still extant on Aeras today.\n\nThe Theugombrians do not, as a rule, recognize slavery. Captives taken in war are either sold back at random, executed if they have attracted some particular ire from their captors, or adopted into the clan itself if the prisoner proves themself willing and useful. In this manner Theugombrian clans can often develop quite a mixed ethnic appearance, with Kathunian, Sarradonian, and even Damotan ancestry not unheard of within individual families.#"

While these isolated settlements were once confined to the shore of this mysterious landmass, a combination of local knowledge and trial and error allowed the Suru'gin to penetrate deeper into Cyrat's harsh interior, establishing successful kingdoms in the process.

In fact, the process in which their characteristic pigment was created was a closely guarded secret, its rarity making it an essential luxury for any self-respecting ruler.

Their presence along the trade-route has become such a fact of life that it is considered foolish for any expedition to set off without a portion of their wares being put aside for any would-be assailants. These raiding parties known to the Asarey as 'Sammalriq' are organised in a strictly egalitarian basis with all 'revenue' being split equally among members.

Instead, they follow a policy of free trade along the ports of their river and its surrounding coast. Their obsession with trade amongst a land of warriors has earned the nickname of ‘River Jackals’, preying upon justly-earned spoils of war with vague promises and backhanded haggling.\n\nDespite their reputation for avarice, the Ekaachi are much more charitable and open than their neighbours, their large port cities attracting visitors from places as far flung as [aversaria|E].

As a culture in control of many overland trade routes, the Paidem have slowly evolved to be a people famed for their discretion. The caravans of the Paidem often unload unexpected goods in foreign markets, and appear to leave without buying a single thing in return. Whilst bafflingly clandestine to most, the deals made by their quick hands often change the fate of their neighbors.\n\nPaidem girls are often trained as spies, reporting on the deeds of their husbands to their fathers and brothers. Such history has given outsiders a hesitancy to marry into Paidem families, and the once expansive lands of their kingdom have slowly shrunk since the [dharya_varha|E] and their failed attempts to play all sides against one another. However, a fall from grace did not stop the nobility of the Paidem; in the shadows, they still work to manipulate the trades of Kashirya to their benefit.#"
 sakankra_desc:0 "#size:15    There is no discussion of the Sakankra that does not mention the Kharadans. Atop massive hills and clinging to the faces of their home mountains, the Sakankra build massive temple-palaces that seem to touch the sky. Within, priest and lord sit on equal thrones, all decisions requiring a unanimous ruling from both to take effect. Crushed under the weight of their own priestly bureaucracy, the Sakankra have grown to be a patient and calm people, unwilling to let the stresses of their system bear down upon them.\n\nThe greatest crisis of the Sakankra came in the [chojakaan_ka_ghatada|E], where the great mountain citadel of Dihothah, the most ancient seat of Sakankran kings, disappeared. The Sakankra were thrown into a series of small civil wars that devastated their once prosperous and peaceful land. At the end of the struggle, only a single line of the ancient nobility was left to rule, and the long meditations at the top of their skyward temples became tied to long bouts of weeping forever more.#"
 saruta_desc:0 "#size:15    Found on the southern reaches of the Night Coast, the Saruta are a nation of spice traders. Their vast markets peddle herbs and spices found only in the rich Pirate Coast, as well as ornate crystal-topped staffs shaped like flowers known as Phulikama. The Saruta historically came to prominence for controlling shipping through the Cayvadaj Strait, building great watchtower cities that charged extortionate tolls for traders to pass. Whilst these cities would eventually grow into trade hubs, they were born as havens of coercion; old tales speak of Sarutan pirates preying on those who avoided their ports.\n\nThe Sarutan right to rule is historically determined by who holds the ancient Phulikam of their city, though many noble families have long since consolidated their right to pass it to their sons and daughters to maintain dynastic control. Many families have also produced a series of hierarchal Phulikama, lengthened in size to display greater rank, yet the massive expense of creating such prized artefacts has made the nobility comparatively poor compared to the classes of spice traders.#"
 lainar_desc:0 "#size:15    The Lainar dwell within the south-eastern heel of Kashirya, and as such have developed a culture made for thick forests and vast wetlands. Their halls are built in concentric circles around great monoliths shaped like local fauna, such as the fearsome Gajara. Daily, their nobles bow their heads before the monoliths at dusk, and in return they are said to be spared from the worst attacks. Despite their customs, however, no creature of their titanic forests is known to spare them tooth or claw.\n\nThe houses of the Lainar are filled with people of all classes, as it is their custom to feed all who come to their table hungry. It is seen as a disgrace not to entertain a weary traveller or sing to those displaced by storms, and so the Lainar often train themselves in the arts of dancing and the playing of the Bansuri flute to ensure that none leave their halls without a smile on their face. Such hospitality, however, also made them easy targets for violence in the [vaarash|E], where their enemies would disguise themselves as starving beggars to murder Lainar leaders in their beds.#"
 ikanita_desc:0 "#size:15    Based out of the island of Wellatola, the Ikanita are a proud culture. A hybrid of the native Deraani and Sarutan explorers, the Ikanita were born in the aftermath of the [dharya_varha|E] and the expulsion of many loyal to the Dharyam Lon. The Ikanita quickly established themselves as master shipwrights, building larger and heavier ships than the original Deraani frequented. These ships have historically kept outsiders from the rich lands of Wellatola, but they have also been known to be used for acts of piracy.\n\nTheir vast island has given them many resources, but few amongst their neighbours have seen the worth in their gifts. The great pit of Paccai Malai gifted them the distinctive gold bands that line their necks, and the leather of the local rovarskan dragons is used by the Ikanita to make thick shields and armour. The Ikanita are one of the most isolationist cultures of Kashirya, and only emerge from their island for trade or plunder.#"
 deraani_desc:0 "#size:15    The native culture of Trinapaawa and the surrounding islands, the Deraani are famed across Kashirya for their naval traditions, especially for their acts of piracy. It is said that the Deraani make piracy seem like fine art, dressing extravagantly and trained to dance with their swords from the age of five. Each clan typically owns a ship for every ten members; no man or woman is fit for marriage or a holding without seizing the cargo of twenty vessels due to their strict clan hierarchies. Battles between the Deraani are common, but are usually solved as quickly as they start with large gatherings between captains known as Tyanan Rudu, where feasting and duelling dominate the long nights.\n\nThe Deraani funerary ritual for a captain is well-documented, and consists of them, and any amongst their crew willing to pass on with them, being tied to the mast of their ship and sent to drift away across the Pirate Coast. Whilst once a quaint gesture, the damage caused to the trade networks of the region has often led to the Deraani being excluded from ports to trade their wares.#"
 sarishta_desc:0 "#size:15    South of the great cities of the Yevanya and fertile fields of the Yonata, the Sarishta people live in the low lying floodplains alongside the tranquil Sea of Glass. Historically oppressed by their Chordhan cousins and subject to heavy tribute from the lords of Valapuiwan, many Sarishta have taken to the sea as respite.\n\n In fact, the Sarishta are known as the finest ship makers in all of Darmirat, and have gained fame across Kashirya for their lightning-fast dhows. Each clan commonly owns several dhows, with their lateen sails decorated with images from Sarishtan folklore or symbols representing their home village. To celebrate their beloved ships, every summer the Sarishta gather to participate in the Jahaaji D’aud, a race across the Sea of Glass from the tip of Selengai to Inkovtara, ending with a great feast to honor the victors. Due to their maritime heritage, many Sarishta make a living fishing in their home water, trading up and down the Kasiryat, and are a common sight on pirate vessels throughout the eastern seas.#" 
 mithaista_desc:0 "#size:15    The Mithaista are the traditional lords of the mountain kingdom of Hyratan, and are regarded as the most noble of all the Aevakori. Of course any “lesser” Aevakori would say different, claiming the Mithaista are an aloof and haughty people, gone senile in their high-altitude citadels, dreaming of glories long past. This holds some truth, as the Mithaista are proficient recordkeepers, and are known throughout Hyratan for their rare books and forgotten knowledge.\n\n In addition to their scholarly pursuits, the Mithaista are well adapted to life in the mountains, as their traditional horse breed, the Cerutku, is closer to a mountain goat in behavior. Short and squat, these nimble steeds carry the Mithaista from peak to peak, and are sought after pack animals for mountaineers across Aeras. The archetypal band of Mithaista crossing the mountains on Cerutku, transporting their precious tomes and scrolls, is a classic sight throughout central Hyratan.#"  
 huxayakha_desc:0 "#size:15    The Huxayakha are an Aevakori people, settled around the Gahareen, a glacial lake in southern Hyratan. The Gahareen is central to Huxayakhan life and much of their wealth is pulled from its depths. Shoals of spotted trout provide sustenance, hides of giant salamanders are sold for their supposed magical properties, and freshwater pearl divers pull trinkets out of the depths. This wealth has led to the development of prominent trade routes throughout the region and wealth from the Gahareen appears in marketplaces across Darmirat. Huxayakhan towns are decorated in lacustrine motifs, and lake spirits are venerated no matter the prevailing beliefs of the age.\n\n As a result of these natural riches, the Huxayakha defend their homes with ferocity and are deadly warriors. Known for their stalwart spears and swift lancers the Huxayakha show no quarter, and the shores of the Gahareen are covered in shrines dedicated to ancient warrior kings.#"  
 pyanaki_desc:0 "#size:15    Diverging from their Ulakada brethren in the aftermath of the [murtuy_ka_varha|E], the Pyanaki sought to rectify their troubles by seeking answers in the hills beside the Kharadans. They built towns around still monasteries, quietly awaiting answers to the troubles that they had faced over the centuries, yet none came. Still, the Pyanaki have remained dominated by their spiritual leaders as much as their kings, seeing mystical truths as vital to their survival as food or water.\n\nThe Pyanaki have remained experts in hill warfare since they emerged, avoiding direct contact in favour of staging long series of ambushes in the hidden crevices of their mounds. Their society has also developed a strange system of seemingly random sacrifice every ninth year, killing a different amount of people for different reasons each time the command is given. Without such a practice, the Pyanaki might have come to dominate their homelands more comprehensively.#" 
 ulakada_desc:0 "#size:15    The Ulakada are a central Kashiryan people native to the banks of the River Parthenay. They are often characterised by their free thinking and adaptivity, and are known for being fickle with their fashions. Their houses are long and flat, with great irrigation systems to feed the crops of their hilly homeland with the Parthenay’s streams. One can be born in one of their towns and watch their entire culture shift multiple times over before death.\n\nHowever, their quick minds have also made them unreliable friends, and many alliances have been made and broken by the Ulakada to keep their home safe. As a result, they weathered the [chan_skorpokaipis|E] especially poorly, unable to find aid amongst their neighbours when they needed it most. Their best scholars eventually managed to rebuild the shattered remnants of their culture, but it has been forever scarred by their capriciousness.#"
 arolyan_desc:0 "#size:15    Arolyans originate in the southern Pirate Coast, on islands so thick with jungles that only the most coastal regions have towns worthy of notice for passing sailors. As such, the Arolyan are jealously protective of the seas around their home, and are known for sprees of killing any who draw too close to their shores. However, their fear of the outsider has slowly waned over the centuries, and now Arolyan ship crews are sometimes filled with Sarutans and Deraani.\n\nArolyan women historically have held the role of warriors exclusively, with men focusing on the arts of stewardship and ruling, believing it to be a higher calling to one day be able to tame their islands for good. The distinctive body tattoos of Arolyan women are easily spotted in Kashiryan ports, depicting each and every victory they have wrought with art so beautiful that some scholars have dedicated years of their lives to it.#"
 samayani_desc:0 "#size:15    The Samayani diverged from the Deraani in the early years of the 5th century, when the ancient kingdom of Trinapaawa was split between the two sons of Ajai ‘Three-Fingers’. The younger of the siblings, Nakhu ‘the Naga’, created a culture of traders instead of raiders on the Samayani islands. Using swift ships so small that travellers often miss them, the Samayani hop between the islands and sell spices and goods from towns and villages they visit (albeit with as few scruples as their pirate ancestors).\n\nDespite their love of ‘fair’ trade instead of piracy, the Samayani are not unknown to be dominated by cliques of pirates living amongst them. The slow return of the culture to one dominated by piracy came following the [sabar_lambay_raad|E], when their Deraani cousins stole the most sacred of their jewels, the Paccai Padyma, from the home of their king in the chaos. With clever trickery and swift oars, the Samayani were reborn as hybrid pirate-merchants.#"
 ilahanai_desc:0 "#size:15    The Ilahanai have traditionally lived along the northern banks of the Theraskiyatt, but over the centuries have moved further inland. Their communities are tightly knit and centred around figures known as ‘clan fathers’. These men are elected every thirty cycles of [aervalr|E], and are expected to arbitrate disputes, teach the young, and co-ordinate defences amongst their villages and towns in preparation for war. Whilst a peaceful and insular people, they are not unresponsive to the pleas of travellers, and will provide shelter or nourishment if needed (if only for a short while).\n\nNearly destroyed by the [chan_skorpokaipis|E], the Ilahanai have only grown more inward-looking with time, believing that the rest of Aeras wishes them dead. Their insularism has transformed into xenophobia, and the clan fathers no longer wash the wounds of the bleeding if they does not know of their patient’s family. Whilst once a quiet and unassuming rural culture, the Ilahanai have completely shut out the world out of a misguided belief that they are unjustly hated.#"
 swabani_desc:0 "#size:15    Born from a mixing of dissident Ilahanai in Yadaniyan cities, the Swabini are a cosmopolitan culture that dominates the artistic sphere of the northern Theraskiyatt. An expressive nation at their core, the Swabani view the greatest pursuit in life as the arts, and thus have thriving urban centres filled with fashions, sculptures, and music arguably unmatched for hundreds of miles. Swabani masters are often seen in the cities of the Darmirat playing upon their mardalas or performing esoteric plays beside the Katuppilan Grove.\n\nHaving emerged in the prosperous days of the [taryaad_saramsaasan|E], the Swabani have always been more performative than skilled. Without his drum, a Swabani master knows no music; without hours of practice, he does not know the words to the tragedy he performs every night. When the [vaarash|E] came, the Swabani failed to survive outside of a few cities and lost many of their great music halls in the chaos that unfolded around them. However, the Swabani have maintained their love of the arts through their many hardships, and their endeavours are still respected across much of Kashirya.#"
 yadaniya_desc:0 "#size:15    The Yadaniya people are dominated by their proximity to Paerasjatan’s Spire. The closeness of the massive [tower|E] to their towns has made them both a haven for scholars and adventurers, all of which wish to unlock the secrets of the spire. Many Yadaniya are also powerful [magi|E], lending their skills out as guides and aides to researching parties. The culture of the Yadaniya is inseparable from the effects of the Spire, and some travellers have noted that the most powerful Yadaniya also seem to be the most sickly.\n\nWhilst once they held great libraries containing centuries of research on the spire, the [dharya_varha|E] destroyed many of their most vital records. The Yadaniya have remained determined, however, to reacquire their lost knowledge, and so have seemingly dedicated their entire culture to the research of the Spire once again. Whilst some of the most potent [magi|E] in Kashirya, the Yadaniya’s insatiable need to understand the Spire has left them a people enslaved to research.#"
 aezentiam_desc:0 "#size:15    The people of Aezentiam are natives of northern Kashirya and known throughout Darmirat for their warrior prowess and sturdy nature, for they have had a long history of dealing with external threats from beyond the Kashiryat. Due to this, they are prized mercenaries and are often sought after by faraway lords, sometimes even made into the royal guard of a particularly wealthy realm.\n\nHowever, as the wheel of time has turned, their military codices have slowly become less and less adhered to, and their own excursions beyond the great river have drastically diminished in frequency. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of people still stubbornly follow the ways of their ancestors and protect their lands from whatever threat may arrive from beyond the sacred river.#"
 vanaarik_desc:0 "#size:15    The Vanaarik are the southwestern branch of the Nakahanii people, who had arrived to the Night Coast in the [akualion_tutil|E] of the 7th century. The Vanaarik trace their roots to the supporters of Emalil 'the Sea Serpent', one of the three rival pretenders that emerged in the succession crisis that followed the murder of King Kaiatu 'the Navigator' and the monarch's widow.\n\nAs the group that had followed the warrior queen in pursuing revenge for the late king's death, the Vanaarik would soon get drawn into decades of bloody warfare with the inhabitants of Thrimbyso. Though the Thryimbysans would ultimately be defeated and almost completely destroyed, the war would leave a lasting effect on the Vanaarik culture, which would remain bellicose and warlike.\n\nSkilled corsairs that prowl the Night Coast and largely only operate after the Sun sets, the Vanaarik have perfected the seemingly impossible art of concealing their ships in illuminated waters, navigating the local reefs and launching ambush attacks on passing ships.#"

Staunchly conservative and isolationist, the Jakana have adhered to their forefathers' way of life the most of all the Nakahanii - though this is not to say that their culture has remained completely static. Over the centuries, practitioners of astrological magic have gone from respected to practically venerated, and they have effectively slipped into magocratic rule.#"
