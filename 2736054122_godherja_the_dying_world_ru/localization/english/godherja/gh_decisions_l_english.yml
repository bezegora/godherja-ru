Additionally, Tetradia and his cohorts are known schemers, veterans of the old days of the Imperial court before the Fenvir landed on the eastern shores.\n\nFor his part, Tetradia has denied any wrongdoing. He has pointed out how idiotic it would be for him to destabilize the Legion when it is his only shot to retake his city, and also how the Kteumaxa have long lusted over ownership of southern Aironoi.\n\nAltan himself has sent us word that if we were to move against Tetradia, his forces will be at our disposal in the case of civil war, and has also stated that his comrades in the northeast will serve thereafter as my vassals.

defeat_rhesus_decision_desc:0 "Rhesus is a politician and schemer without equal. As formidable as Cenware is on the field of battle, so is Rhesus in the halls of power. And like the High King of the Sjalvolki, he will not be beaten in one fight, and the fight will be intense indeed."

Our historic capital at To Pedíthípsi is an uninhabitable wasteland - more a mocking exhibit of Imperial arrogance than a viable foundation for the center of our new state, and Palát to Mytidon is out of the question for obvious reasons. Though we may hold our past dear, we must establish a new capital from which to rule fair Mytidon. Be advised, the costs will be high and construction will take a full year to complete."
