Managed to accidentally land his force in the middle of the High Kings entire mercenary army since he's incompetent but then whipped the fuck out of them since he's still more competent than anyone in the Empire. Now chugging brewskies with the boys and getting ready to shove his dick so hard up the Empire's backside. He's also a trustfund baby with a hella connected daddy in the Sjalvolki who will blood eagle the fuck out of the High King and every other Aversarian who can see a coastline if anything happens to his boy.
